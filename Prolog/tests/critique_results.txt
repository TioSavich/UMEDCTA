=== CRITIQUE MECHANISM TESTS ===


[TEST] Stress Map: Recording Failures
  Stress tracking working correctly
  PASS

[TEST] Commitment Extraction from Proof
  Successfully extracted commitments from proof
  PASS

[TEST] Bad Infinite: Cycle Detection
  Cycle detection requires proof generation
  Structure defined (implementation pending)
  PASS

[TEST] Identify Most Stressed Commitment
  Correctly identified most stressed commitment
  PASS

[TEST] Resource Exhaustion: Stress Recording
Handling Resource Exhaustion for: [s(u)]=>[s(comp_nec(a))]
  Incremented stress for: [s(u)]=>[s(comp_nec(a))]
  Resource exhaustion recorded. External intervention required.
  Resource exhaustion recorded in stress map
  PASS

[TEST] Incoherence: Belief Revision
  Testing belief revision mechanism...
Handling Incoherence in Commitments: [([a,b]=>c)]
Retracting/Modifying stressed commitment: [a,b]=>c
Blocking problematic commitment: [a,b]=>c
  Belief revision attempted (dynamic assertion may vary)
  PASS

[TEST] Bad Infinite: Sublation Mechanism
  Testing sublation mechanism...
Handling Bad Infinite (Pathological Cycle): [node(pml_rhythm((s(t_b)=>s(comp_nec(t_n)))),([s(t_b)]=>[s(comp_nec(t_n))])),node(pml_rhythm((s(t_n)=>s(comp_nec(t_b)))),([s(t_n)]=>[s(comp_nec(t_b))]))]
  Detected oscillation between: [([s(t_b)]=>[s(comp_nec(t_n))]),([s(t_n)]=>[s(comp_nec(t_b))])]
  SUBLATION REQUIRED: Introduce higher-level concept to resolve oscillation
  Example: Being <-> Nothing requires "Becoming"
  System cannot auto-generate new concepts yet.
    Marked as stressed: [s(t_b)]=>[s(comp_nec(t_n))] via pml_rhythm((s(t_b)=>s(comp_nec(t_n))))
    Marked as stressed: [s(t_n)]=>[s(comp_nec(t_b))] via pml_rhythm((s(t_n)=>s(comp_nec(t_b))))
  External conceptual intervention required.
  Bad Infinite elements marked as stressed
  PASS
