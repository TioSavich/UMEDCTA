This analysis outlines a framework for synthesizing Robert Brandom's incompatibility semantics with the embodied mathematics of Lakoff and Núñez (L\&N). The goal is to "level up" the existing `incompatibility_semantics.pl` by grounding its material inferences and incompatibilities in conceptual metaphor, thereby explaining the *necessity* of mathematical truths through the constraints of embodied experience.

The central organizing principle is: **Conceptual metaphors are the cognitive algorithms that propagate incompatibility and entailment from embodied source domains to abstract target domains.**

### I. The Architecture of Embodied Incompatibility

We propose a hierarchical architecture where the incompatibility of mathematical statements is derived from the structure of the metaphors used to understand them.

#### 1\. The Embodied Core: Source Domains and Image Schemas

Before mathematics, there is the logic of space and action. This layer defines the fundamental material inferences and incompatibilities of embodied experience.

**A. Domain: Spatial Logic (Container Schema)**
The logic of boundaries, interiors, and exteriors.

  * **Embodied Incompatibility:** It is physically impossible for an object X to be simultaneously entirely inside Container C and entirely outside C.
      * `Incoherent({ In(X, C), Out(X, C) })`.
      * *Grounds:* The Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC).
  * **Embodied Inference (Transitivity):** If A is in B, and B is in C, then A must be in C.
      * `{ In(A, B), In(B, C) } => { In(A, C) }`.
      * *Grounds:* Syllogistic reasoning and Modus Ponens.

**B. Domain: Object Manipulation**
The logic of collecting physical objects.

  * **Embodied Incompatibility:** You cannot take a larger collection B away from a smaller collection A.
      * `Incoherent({ TakeAway(A, B, _), Size(A) < Size(B) })`.
  * **Embodied Inference (Commutativity of Union):** Putting A together with B results in the same size collection as putting B together with A.

**C. Domain: Spatial Logic (Rotation)**
The logic of spatial orientation.

  * **Embodied Inference:** Two 180° rotations return an object to its starting orientation.
  * **Embodied Inference:** Two 90° rotations are equivalent to one 180° rotation.

### II. Metaphors as Inference Propagation Mechanisms

Conceptual metaphors transfer the inferential structure of the Embodied Core to mathematical domains.

#### 1\. Grounding Metaphors (The 4Gs) and the Naturals (N)

**Metaphor: Arithmetic is Object Collection (AOC)**

This metaphor maps Object Manipulation to the Natural Numbers (N).

  * **Generated Incompatibility (Subtraction Constraint):** The physical impossibility of taking larger from smaller generates the arithmetic incoherence of `Minus(A, B, _)` when `A < B` in Domain N.
      * This justifies the existing logic in `incompatibility_semantics.pl`:
    <!-- end list -->
    ```prolog
    is_incoherent(X) :-
        member(n(obj_coll(minus(A,B,_))), X),
        current_domain(n),
        ...
        NA < NB, !.
    ```
  * **Generated Inference (Commutativity):** The physical equivalence of union order generates the arithmetic rule `A + B = B + A`.

#### 2\. Linking Metaphors and Domain Extension

Mathematics evolves by encountering incoherences generated by existing metaphors and resolving them by adopting new metaphors, resulting in domain shifts.

**A. The Shift to Integers (Z)**

  * **The Conflict:** `3 - 5` is incoherent under AOC (Domain N).
  * **The Resolution:** Adopt the **"Numbers Are Points on a Line" (NPL)** and **"Multiplication by -1 is 180° Rotation"** metaphors (Domain Z).
  * **Semantic Impact:**
    1.  **Resolving Incoherence:** NPL uses the Source-Path-Goal schema, allowing movement past the origin. The subtraction constraint is dropped.
    2.  **New Inferences:** The system inherits the logic of rotation. The spatial fact that two 180° rotations return to the start generates the necessity that `(-1) * (-1) = 1`.

**B. The Shift to Complex Numbers (C)**

  * **The Conflict:** $x^2 = -1$ is incoherent in the domain of Reals.
  * **The Resolution:** Adopt **"Multiplication by *i* is a 90° Rotation"** (Domain C).
  * **Semantic Impact:** The system inherits the logic of 90° rotation. The spatial fact that two 90° rotations equal one 180° rotation generates the necessity that $i^2 = -1$.

### III. The Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI)

The BMI conceptualizes an unending process (Potential Infinity) as having a unique, final resultant state (Actual Infinity). In the framework, the BMI acts as a structural rule that licenses new commitments.

  * **Mechanism:** The BMI projects the inferential structure of a *completed* process onto an *unending* process.

**A. Grounding Mathematical Induction**

Induction is the inferential structure of the BMI made explicit.

  * **Source Incompatibility (Completed Process):** It is incompatible for a property P to hold at the start, be preserved at every step, yet fail to hold for the final resultant state.
  * **Target Incompatibility (Infinite Set):** When applied to the process of counting (the set N), this grounds the Principle of Induction. It is incoherent to accept the premises of induction but deny the conclusion for the whole set.

**B. Grounding Limits**

The BMI entails that the final state is unique. In calculus, this means a converging sequence (conceptualized as a completed process) can have only one limit (the final state).

### IV. Formalization and Discretization

This layer addresses the shift in modern mathematics toward discrete, set-theoretic structures, driven by the "Discretization Program."

  * **Key Metaphors:** Spaces are Sets of Points; Functions are Sets of Ordered Pairs; Continuity is Preservation of Closeness (Epsilon-Delta).
  * **Semantic Impact:** These metaphors redefine the conditions of incompatibility. For example, the embodied concept of continuity (no gaps) is replaced by the Weierstrass definition.
  * **The Role of the Framework:** The incompatibility semantics can model both the embodied and the formal definitions, demonstrating that they operate under different metaphorical systems. This makes explicit that the "truth" of formal mathematics is relative to the acceptance of these specific discretization metaphors, rather than being a transcendent fact.

### Summary

By structuring the incompatibility semantics around these metaphorical mechanisms, we achieve the synthesis. The system models how the abstract "saying" of mathematics is grounded in the embodied "doing" of human cognition, tracing the necessity of mathematical inference back to the constraints of embodied experience.

This analysis synthesizes the philosophical framework of Robert Brandom’s *Between Saying and Doing* (BSD) with the cognitive linguistics of Lakoff and Núñez (L&N) in *Where Mathematics Comes From*. The goal is to demonstrate how Brandom's Analytic Pragmatism—specifically the methodology of Meaning-Use Analysis (MUA) and the concept of the LX relation—provides the structure necessary to formalize L&N's insights into a robust account of mathematical cognition and semantics.

The central thesis of this synthesis is: **Conceptual metaphors (L&N) function as the mechanisms of pragmatic elaboration (BSD) that allow embodied practices to confer content on abstract mathematical vocabularies. The resulting mathematical necessity is the explicit expression (the 'X' in LX) of the constraints inherent in those embodied practices.**

This approach moves beyond analyzing the *content* of mathematics (as in the existing incompatibility semantics) to analyzing the *practices* that constitute mathematical understanding, utilizing the "whole system" of BSD.

### I. The Framework: Analytic Pragmatism and MUA

BSD extends the classical project of analysis by shifting focus from direct semantic relations (meaning-to-meaning) to **pragmatically mediated semantic relations** (meaning-to-use-to-meaning). This shift is essential for understanding L&N, who argue that mathematical content is not abstractly derived but arises from embodied *use*.

MUA provides the formal tools for this analysis:

*   **PV-Sufficiency:** Practices sufficient to deploy a Vocabulary.
*   **VP-Sufficiency:** Vocabulary sufficient to specify Practices.
*   **PP-Sufficiency:** Practices sufficient (in principle) for other Practices.
*   **Pragmatic Metavocabulary:** A vocabulary (V1) that specifies the practices (P) sufficient to deploy another vocabulary (V2).

### II. Conceptual Metaphor as Pragmatic Elaboration (PP-Sufficiency)

A key concept in BSD is **PP-Sufficiency**, particularly how one set of abilities can be elaborated into another. Brandom distinguishes two crucial types (BSD, Ch. 3):

1.  **Algorithmic Elaboration:** Abilities fully decomposable into primitive abilities executed according to a defined algorithm (e.g., long division decomposing into subtraction and multiplication).
2.  **Practical Elaboration by Training (Pragmatic Projection):** Abilities developed from prior abilities through experience and training, which cannot be strictly algorithmically decomposed. This process is contingent, embodied, and relies on the capacity to "go on in the same way" (Wittgenstein).

L&N's conceptual metaphors are the primary engine of PP-sufficiency in mathematics. They are largely instances of **Practical Elaboration (Pragmatic Projection)** rather than strict algorithms.

#### Case Study: Arithmetic is Object Collection (AOC)

The AOC metaphor allows us to leverage embodied skills in manipulating objects (P-Objects) to develop skills in manipulating numbers (P-Arithmetic).

*   **P-Objects:** Distinguishing, grouping, combining, and removing physical items.
*   **The Elaboration (AOC):** The metaphor is the cognitive mechanism that projects P-Objects onto P-Arithmetic. It is how we "go on" from dealing with collections to dealing with numbers.
*   **P-Arithmetic:** Counting, adding, subtracting.

This relationship establishes P-Objects as PP-sufficient for P-Arithmetic.

### III. Pragmatic Expressive Bootstrapping

This structure results in what Brandom calls **Pragmatic Expressive Bootstrapping**. The vocabulary of embodied experience (V-Embodied) is expressively weaker than the vocabulary of mathematics (V-Math). However, V-Embodied can serve as a **Pragmatic Metavocabulary** for V-Math.

We can *specify* the practice of addition ("Putting collection A with collection B") using V-Embodied. This practice, elaborated via the AOC metaphor, is PV-sufficient to deploy the concept 'addition' in V-Math.

This explains how mathematics is grounded in embodiment without being semantically reducible to it. The grounding is a pragmatically mediated semantic relation.

### IV. The Embodied LX Relation: Grounding Logic and Modality

BSD's central philosophical claim concerns the **LX (Elaborated-Explicating) Relation**. Brandom argues that logical and modal vocabularies are "Universally LX": they are (L) elaborated from practices necessary for *any* autonomous discourse, and (X) they make those implicit practices explicit.

The synthesis with L&N reveals the embodied origins of these universally necessary practices.

#### A. Logic and the Container Schema

*   **Brandom:** Logic makes explicit the practices of inference and incompatibility inherent in any discourse.
*   **L&N:** The fundamental laws of logic (e.g., Excluded Middle, Modus Ponens) are material inferences derived from the **Container Schema** (the embodied experience of boundaries, interiors, and exteriors).
*   **Synthesis:** The practices Brandom identifies as universally necessary (recognizing incompatibility) are grounded in pre-linguistic, embodied schemas. The Container Schema provides the basic structure of incompatibility (In vs. Out). Logic is universally LX because it explicates the embodied structure underlying all conceptualization.

#### B. Modality and Embodied Constraints (The Kant-Sellars Thesis)

*   **Brandom:** Modal vocabulary (necessity/possibility) makes explicit the *counterfactual robustness* of inferences implicit in the use of ordinary concepts (The Kant-Sellars Thesis, BSD Ch. 4).
*   **L&N:** Mathematical necessity arises from the constraints of the embodied source domain being projected onto the target domain.
*   **Synthesis:** The Kant-Sellars thesis is realized through the grounding metaphors. The modal structure Brandom highlights is inherited from the physical constraints of embodied experience.

*Example:* In the AOC metaphor, it is physically impossible to combine a collection of 3 and a collection of 2 and get a collection of 6. This embodied incompatibility (a modal constraint) is projected onto the Natural Numbers. The mathematical necessity ("3+2 *must* be 5") is the LX vocabulary making explicit the constraints inherent in the grounding practices.

### V. The Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI) as an LX Structure

The BMI, which conceptualizes an unending process as having a final, resultant state, is a powerful illustration of the LX structure generating advanced mathematics.

1.  **The Implicit Practice:** Engaging in iterative processes (P-Iterative), such as counting or dividing segments ("Potential Infinity").
2.  **The Elaboration (L):** The BMI is the pragmatic elaboration (PP-Sufficiency) that maps the structure of *completed* processes (P-Completed) onto P-Iterative. It adds a metaphorical "final state."
3.  **The Explication (X):** The vocabulary of "Actual Infinity" (limits, infinite sets, $\omega$) makes explicit the new inferential structure generated by the BMI.

**Mathematical Induction:** The Principle of Induction is the LX consequence of the BMI. It explicitly codifies the inferential commitments adopted when we use the metaphor of completion. Induction relies on the structure of P-Completed: if a property holds at the start and is preserved by the process, it *must* hold at the final resultant state.

### Conclusion

By integrating the "whole system" of BSD with L&N, we provide a rigorous framework for embodied mathematics within analytic pragmatism.

1.  **MUA provides the formalism:** L&N’s cognitive mechanisms are analyzed as specific types of Meaning-Use Relations (PP-sufficiency, pragmatic elaboration).
2.  **Metaphor drives elaboration:** Conceptual metaphors are the mechanisms (often practical projections rather than strict algorithms) that elaborate embodied practices into abstract mathematical abilities.
3.  **LX explains necessity and logic:** The necessity of mathematics and the universality of logic are explained as the explicit articulation (LX) of constraints inherent in the embodied practices (Image Schemas) that underlie all discourse.
