# A Knowledge Base of Conceptual Metaphors in Arithmetic

This document outlines the Four Grounding Metaphors for arithmetic as described in Lakoff and Núñez's "Where Mathematics Comes From," and maps common arithmetic strategies to them.

## 1. The Arithmetic Is Object Collection Metaphor

This is one of the most fundamental grounding metaphors for arithmetic, arising from the everyday experience of gathering objects into groups or piles.

*   **Source Domain:** The physical activity of collecting objects. This includes actions like putting objects into collections, taking them out, and forming larger collections from smaller ones.
*   **Target Domain:** The abstract domain of numbers and arithmetic operations.
*   **Key Mappings & Entailments:**
    *   **Numbers:** Collections of objects are conceptualized as numbers. The size of the collection corresponds to the magnitude of the number.
    *   **Addition:** The action of putting collections together corresponds to addition. This entails commutativity (`A+B = B+A`) and associativity (`A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C`), as the final collection is the same regardless of the order of combination.
    *   **Subtraction:** The action of taking a smaller collection from a larger one corresponds to subtraction.
    *   **Multiplication:** This is understood through two extensions:
        1.  **Iteration:** Repeatedly adding a collection of a certain size `B`, `A` times.
        2.  **Pooling:** Combining `A` subcollections, each of size `B`.
    *   **Division:** This is also understood through two extensions:
        1.  **Iteration:** Repeatedly subtracting a collection of size `B` from a larger collection of size `C` to find the number of times (`A`) it can be done.
        2.  **Splitting:** Splitting a collection of size `C` into `A` equal subcollections of size `B`.
    *   **Zero:** This metaphor requires the ad-hoc creation of the *Zero Collection Metaphor*, where the absence of objects is conceptualized as a special "empty collection." This allows for an additive identity (`A + 0 = A`).

*   **Mapped Strategies:**
    *   **Counting and Counting On:** This strategy involves counting discrete units, which is the fundamental action of determining the size of a collection.
    *   **Coordinating Two Counts (C2C):** The description "Nested counting: items within group, groups within total" is the very essence of multiplication as the pooling of collections.
    *   **Dealing by Ones (Division - Sharing):** This strategy of distributing units into groups is a direct physical instantiation of division grounded in object collection.
    *   **Commutative Reasoning (Multiplication):** Choosing between `A x B` and `B x A` is choosing whether to conceptualize the problem as "A collections of B objects" or "B collections of A objects."
    *   **Conversion to Bases and Ones (CBO Multiplication):** This strategy involves redistributing units among different collections to create more convenient collections (base units), a clear manipulation of object collections.
    *   **Subtraction Decomposition (Borrowing):** The act of "borrowing" is conceptually breaking up a larger collection (e.g., a ten) into a collection of smaller units (ten ones) to facilitate subtraction.

## 2. The Arithmetic Is Object Construction Metaphor

This metaphor conceptualizes numbers as whole objects that are constructed from basic parts. It is closely related to Object Collection but emphasizes the internal structure of numbers.

*   **Source Domain:** The physical activity of constructing objects by putting parts together.
*   **Target Domain:** The abstract domain of numbers and arithmetic operations.
*   **Key Mappings & Entailments:**
    *   **Numbers:** Objects made of ultimate, indivisible parts are conceptualized as numbers. The size of the object corresponds to the size of the number.
    *   **Addition:** The action of putting parts together to form a larger object corresponds to addition.
    *   **Subtraction:** The action of taking a part away from an object corresponds to subtraction.
    *   **Multiplication:** The action of fitting together `A` parts, each of size `B`, to make a whole object of size `C`.
    *   **Division:** The action of splitting a whole object of size `C` into `A` equal parts, each of size `B`.
    *   **Fractions:** This metaphor provides a natural grounding for fractions. A simple fraction (`1/n`) is a part made by splitting a unit object into `n` pieces. A complex fraction (`m/n`) is an object made by combining `m` of those parts.
    *   **Zero:** Like the Object Collection metaphor, this requires the *Zero Object Metaphor*, where the lack of an object corresponds to the number zero.

*   **Mapped Strategies:**
    *   **Rearranging to Make Bases (RMB):** The core action is to "decompose B = K + R," which is to conceptualize the number B as an object constructed of two parts.
    *   **Chunking (Addition):** The description "Decompose B into large base chunk + strategic residual chunks" is explicitly about treating numbers as objects that can be broken into parts.
    *   **Subtraction Chunking (Backwards by Part):** This involves subtracting "decomposed parts," which relies on viewing the subtrahend as a constructed object.
    *   **Subtraction CBBO (Counting Back):** This strategy involves subtracting parts of the subtrahend ("decomposed S"), which requires viewing it as a constructed object.
    *   **Distributive Reasoning (Multiplication):** "Decompose S = S1 + S2" is the fundamental move of this strategy, treating a number as an object made of parts.
    *   **Inverse Distributive Reasoning (Division):** This strategy involves decomposing the dividend `T` into parts that are convenient multiples, again grounding it in object construction.
    *   **Conversion to Groups Other than Bases (CGOB Division):** This relies on the "base decomposition of dividend T," viewing the number as an object constructed from its place-value components.

## 3. The Measuring Stick Metaphor

This metaphor grounds arithmetic in the experience of measuring distances using physical segments. It links arithmetic to geometry.

*   **Source Domain:** The use of physical segments (like a measuring stick, a string, or body parts) to determine length.
*   **Target Domain:** The abstract domain of numbers and arithmetic operations.
*   **Key Mappings & Entailments:**
    *   **Numbers:** Physical segments are conceptualized as numbers. The length of the segment corresponds to the magnitude of the number.
    *   **One:** A basic physical segment is chosen as the unit (`1`).
    *   **Addition:** Placing physical segments end-to-end to form a longer segment corresponds to addition.
    *   **Subtraction:** Taking a shorter physical segment from a larger one corresponds to subtraction.
    *   **Multiplication & Division:** These are understood through fitting segments together or dividing them up, similar to the Object Construction metaphor.
    *   **Fractions & Irrationals:** This metaphor naturally grounds fractions (parts of a unit segment). Crucially, the conceptual blend of numbers and continuous line segments gives rise to **irrational numbers** (e.g., √2), as there must be a number corresponding to every possible length, even those not expressible as fractions.

*   **Mapped Strategies:**
    *   **Using Commutative Reasoning (Division):** This strategy, also known as measurement division, conceptualizes division as "iteratively accumulating G until total E reached." This is analogous to using a measuring stick of length G to measure a total length E.
    *   **Subtraction Sliding (Constant Difference):** This strategy involves preserving the *distance* (a length) between two numbers by sliding them both along a line. This is grounded in the manipulation of physical segments and lengths.

## 4. The Arithmetic Is Motion Along a Path Metaphor

This metaphor grounds arithmetic in the experience of moving along a path, linking numbers to locations and movement. It provides the most natural grounding for the number line.

*   **Source Domain:** The physical act of moving along a path from a source to a destination.
*   **Target Domain:** The abstract domain of numbers and arithmetic operations.
*   **Key Mappings & Entailments:**
    *   **Numbers:** Point-locations on a path are conceptualized as numbers.
    *   **Zero:** The origin (starting point) of the path naturally corresponds to zero.
    *   **Magnitude:** The distance from the origin corresponds to the magnitude of the number.
    *   **Addition:** Moving away from the origin along the path corresponds to addition.
    *   **Subtraction:** Moving toward the origin along the path corresponds to subtraction.
    *   **Multiplication & Division:** These are understood as iterated movements along the path.
    *   **Negative Numbers:** This metaphor provides a natural grounding for negative numbers as point-locations on the path on the opposite side of the origin from the positive numbers.

*   **Mapped Strategies:**
    *   **Counting and Counting On:** "Sequential unit counting" is a direct analogue for taking sequential steps along a path.
    *   **COBO (Counting On by Bases then Ones):** The description "iterate base jumps (+Base) then unit steps (+1)" is explicitly about motion along a path.
    *   **Rounding and Adjusting (Addition & Subtraction):** These strategies rely on the concept of a number being "closer" to a base, which is a spatial intuition grounded in the number line (a path).
    *   **Subtraction Chunking (Forwards from Part):** "Count Up... accumulating D" describes moving from one point to another on a path and measuring the distance.
    *   **Subtraction Chunking (Backwards to Part):** "Count Back from M toward S" is explicit motion along a path.
    *   **Subtraction COBO (Missing Addend):** "Start at S, perform base jumps toward M" is a clear description of goal-directed motion on a path.
    *   **Subtraction Sliding (Constant Difference):** This strategy involves sliding two points along a path while maintaining the distance between them.
