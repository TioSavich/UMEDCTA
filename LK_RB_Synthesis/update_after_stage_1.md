This is an exceptionally ambitious and exciting project. The synthesis of Brandom's *Between Saying and Doing* (BSD) with Lakoff and Núñez's *Where Mathematics Comes From* (WMCF) through executable cognitive models offers a powerful way to ground abstract inferential roles in embodied cognitive practices.

The `SlidingAutomaton` is an excellent starting point. To move forward, we need to balance scaling the implementation (the 24 strategies) with deepening the theoretical analysis (WMCF insights and Meaning-Use Diagrams). I recommend an approach that tightly integrates the theoretical analysis directly into the code infrastructure. This will streamline the generation of MUDs and the verification of theoretical claims like "Rearranging to Make Bases is LX for Counting On."

Here is a detailed roadmap articulated as instructions for your VS Code coding agent and tasks for the Google Jules agent platform.

### I. VS Code Agent: Infrastructure and Analytical Framework

The immediate goal is to establish a robust, scalable infrastructure that embeds the Meaning-Use Analysis (MUA) directly into the automaton structure.

#### 1\. Define MUA Metadata Structures

Create a dedicated file to define the data structures capturing the theoretical analysis.

**Instructions for VS Code Agent:**

1.  Create `src/analysis/MUA_Metadata.py`.
2.  Implement the following `dataclasses`:

<!-- end list -->

```python
# src/analysis/MUA_Metadata.py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

@dataclass
class EmbodiedMetaphor:
    """Describes the Lakoff/Núñez conceptual metaphors involved (WMCF)."""
    name: str # e.g., "Arithmetic as Motion Along a Path"
    source_domain: str
    target_domain: str
    entailments: str # Key entailments relevant to the strategy

@dataclass
class MaterialInference:
    """Describes the key Brandomian material inferences enacted (BSD)."""
    name: str # e.g., "Invariance of Distance under Translation"
    premise: str
    conclusion: str
    # Practices required to competently make this inference (PP-Necessities)
    prerequisites: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)

@dataclass
class StrategyMetadata:
    """Metadata container for analyzing a specific strategy."""
    strategy_name: str
    description: str = ""
    metaphors: List[EmbodiedMetaphor] = field(default_factory=list)
    inferences: List[MaterialInference] = field(default_factory=list)
    visualization_hints: List[str] = field(default_factory=list) # e.g., ["NumberLine", "Blocks"]
```

#### 2\. Create the Abstract Base Automaton

Generalize the automaton structure using an Abstract Base Class (ABC). We will use a flexible `registers` dictionary to handle the diverse internal states of different strategies easily.

**Instructions for VS Code Agent:**

1.  Create `src/automata/BaseAutomaton.py`.
2.  Implement the `BaseAutomaton` ABC:

<!-- end list -->

```python
# src/automata/BaseAutomaton.py
import pandas as pd
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from src.analysis.MUA_Metadata import StrategyMetadata
import json
from typing import Dict

class BaseAutomaton(ABC):
    def __init__(self, inputs: Dict, Base=10):
        self.inputs = inputs # Dictionary of initial inputs (e.g., {'M': 73, 'S': 47})
        self.Base = Base
        self.history = []
        self.state = 'q_start'
        self.Result = 0
        self.registers = {} # Flexible dictionary for internal registers

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def metadata(self) -> StrategyMetadata:
        """Must be implemented by subclasses to provide MUA metadata."""
        pass

    def _record_history(self, interpretation, highlight=False):
        # This method now automatically captures the state of all registers
        self.history.append({
            'State': self.state,
            'Interpretation': interpretation,
            'Registers': self.registers.copy(), # Crucial: use copy()
            'Highlight': highlight
        })

    def transition(self, next_state):
        self.state = next_state

    def run(self):
        while self.state not in ['q_accept', 'q_error']:
            executor = getattr(self, f"execute_{self.state}", self.execute_error)
            executor()
        return self.Result

    @abstractmethod
    def execute_q_start(self):
        pass

    def execute_error(self):
        if self.state != 'q_error':
            self._record_history(f"Error: Entered unknown state {self.state}")
            self.transition('q_error')

    def execute_q_accept(self):
        pass # Final state

    # (Include display_history method adapted from the original code)

    def export_trace_json(self):
        """Exports the execution history and metadata for visualization and analysis."""
        # Note: Serialization might require handling dataclass conversion if not using Python 3.10+
        return json.dumps({
            "metadata": self.metadata.__dict__,
            "history": self.history
        }, indent=4)
```

#### 3\. Refactor `SlidingAutomaton`

Update the existing script to inherit from `BaseAutomaton`, use the flexible `registers`, and populate its metadata.

**Instructions for VS Code Agent:**

1.  Modify `SAR_SUB_Sliding.py` in the Python_Tests folder (move it into the new structure, e.g., `src/automata/subtraction/`). We probably DO NOT need the testing part of the script which includes specific values, but those specific values are exemplary for demonstrating the strategy so they may be useful. 
2.  Update the `__init__` method to use the `BaseAutomaton` structure.
3.  Migrate internal variables (K, M\_adj, S\_adj, etc.) into `self.registers`.
4.  Populate the `_metadata` property with the initial analysis (e.g., identifying "Arithmetic as Motion" as the metaphor and "Invariance of Distance under Translation" as the material inference).
5.  Repeat with the other automata in the Python_Tests folder that begin with SAR (Strategic additive reasoning, which includes subtraction) or SMR (Strategic Multiplicative Reasoning, which includes division). 

### II. Jules Platform: Automation and Analysis

Leverage the Jules platform to accelerate the implementation of the 24 strategies and deepen the theoretical analysis.

#### Task 1: Automating Strategy Conversion Pipeline

  * **Goal:** Convert the 24 strategies from `HC_GEM.tex` into Python skeletons.
  * **Agent 1 (LaTeX Parser):**
      * **Input:** `HC_GEM.tex`
      * **Instructions:** Parse the LaTeX file. Extract the `Name`, `Description`, `Cognitive_Steps` (a list of sequential steps), and `Examples` for each strategy.
      * **Output:** A structured JSON list of strategies.
  * **Agent 2 (Python Skeleton Generator):**
      * **Input:** JSON output from Agent 1; `BaseAutomaton.py` definition.
      * **Instructions:** Generate Python files inheriting from `BaseAutomaton`. Populate the `_metadata` skeleton (Name, Description). Use the `Cognitive_Steps` to generate placeholder state methods (`execute_q_step1`, `execute_q_step2`, etc.) with `pass` implementations.
      * **Output:** Python script files ready for manual implementation.

#### Task 2: Comprehensive WMCF Analysis

  * **Goal:** Create a structured knowledge base of the conceptual metaphors.
  * **Jules Prompt:** "Conduct a detailed analysis of Lakoff and Núñez's 'Where Mathematics Comes From'. Focus on the Four Grounding Metaphors (4Gs): Object Collection, Object Construction, Measuring Stick, and Motion Along a Path. For each metaphor, detail the source domain, target domain, and the key entailments relevant to arithmetic operations. Map the 24 strategies (using the descriptions from Task 1) to these grounding metaphors."

#### Task 3: Detailed Brandomian Analysis

  * **Goal:** Analyze material inferences, construct MUDs, and verify theoretical claims.
  * **Jules Prompt (Part A - Inferences and MUDs):** "Analyze the strategies (starting with Sliding, Counting On, and Rearranging) through the lens of Brandom's Meaning-Use Analysis. For each strategy:
    1.  Identify the central material inferences enacted in the key states.
    2.  Articulate the **PP-Necessities** (Prerequisite practices) and **PP-Sufficiencies** (Practices sufficient to deploy the strategy).
    3.  Define the **Circumstances** and **Consequences** of Application.
    4.  Generate a preliminary Meaning-Use Diagram structure, perhaps using Mermaid or DOT syntax."
  * **Jules Prompt (Part B - LX Relation):** "Evaluate the claim: 'Rearranging to Make Bases is LX for Counting On.' Apply Brandom's criteria for the LX (Linguistically Elaborated) relation. Analyze how the explicit steps in 'Rearranging' (decomposition, association, use of base structure) allow us to *say* what 'Counting On' merely *does* (iterative counting)."

### III. VS Code Agent: Implementation and Synthesis

**Instructions for VS Code Agent:**

1.  **Implement Key Strategies:**

      * Prioritize implementing the "Counting On" and "Rearranging to Make Bases" skeletons generated by Jules.
      * Use the analysis from Jules (Task 2 and 3) to populate the `MaterialInference` and `EmbodiedMetaphor` fields in the `_metadata` for these classes.

2.  **Develop MUD Generation Tooling:**

      * Create a utility (e.g., `src/analysis/generate_MUD.py`) that takes a `BaseAutomaton` instance as input.
      * Use the `graphviz` Python library or Mermaid syntax generation to visualize the MUD, mapping the metadata and the analysis from Jules Task 3 into the diagram structure.

3.  **Integrate Visualizations:**

      * Update your HTML/JS visualization scripts to consume the JSON output from `export_trace_json()`.
      * Use the `visualization_hints` in the metadata to load the appropriate visualization (number line for Sliding, blocks for Rearranging).
