# The Hermeneutic Hero: Legends of Logic

## Overview
This is a retro-style RPG adventure game designed to teach mathematical strategies through gameplay. You play as a Teacher/Hero who must defeat "Number Monsters" using cognitive strategies like "Rearranging to Make Bases" (RMB) and "Sliding".

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)

## How to Play
1.  Navigate to the `MathAdventure` directory.
2.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    python3 math_adventure.py
    ```
3.  **Controls:**
    -   **Arrow Keys:** Move around the world.
    -   **Enter:** Start Game / Confirm.
    -   **1, 2, 3:** Select Spells in Battle.
    -   **Keyboard:** Type answers to math problems.

## The Spells (Strategies)
-   **Count:** Basic counting. Good for small numbers.
-   **RMB (Rearranging to Make Bases):** Use this when adding numbers. You must find the "Gap" to the next base (e.g., 10, 20, 30).
-   **Sliding:** Use this for subtraction. Adjust both numbers to make the subtrahend a friendly base number.
