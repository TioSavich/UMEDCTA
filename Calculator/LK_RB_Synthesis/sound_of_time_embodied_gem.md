This adaptation focuses on rewriting and extending the guided exercises within Chapter 1. It integrates the embodied metaphors identified by Lakoff and Núñez—such as the Four Grounding Metaphors for arithmetic (the 4Gs), Categories are Containers, and States are Locations—into the existing meditative practices. The goal is to allow the reader to *feel* these sensory-motor schemas as natural descriptions of the proprioceptive awareness and release cultivated by the practice.

### 2 The Exercise: A Guided Meditation

Before beginning, remember that we are exploring the "sound of time"—the rhythm of compression (focusing, defining) and decompression (releasing, integrating). This practice is not merely about relaxation; it is an exploration of how concepts themselves are born from embodied experience. As Lakoff and Núñez demonstrated, our most abstract understandings, including mathematics, are grounded in our basic sensory-motor experiences: collecting objects, building structures, measuring distances, and moving along paths. In these exercises, we will observe these grounding metaphors as they arise naturally within the field of awareness.

#### 2.1 Exercise 0: Dragging Yourself to The Exercise (Shifting Location)

Are you ready to practice? *I don't want to practice! I feel stuck.* Come on, you know you'll feel better once you move... *NO!*

Notice the quality of this resistance. It often feels spatial. We intuitively understand our mental and emotional **States as Locations**: we are "in" a mood, "stuck" in frustration, or "trapped" by obligations. This resistance says, "I will not be moved." This first "NO!" is a fixation in your current location, a contraction that anchors you here.

If you are resisting the practice, let me give you a secret for how I change my location without fighting myself. It's a way to stay true to yourself—*what* you are—while still allowing you to change *where* you are in the world.

I take that first "NO!"—the one that says "I will not be moved from this spot." Instead of trying to force movement (which just creates more tension), I direct a second "NO!" towards the *fixity* of the spot itself.

This second negation, this determinate negation of determinate negation (~~no~~), does not necessarily mean "yes" to the practice. It does not force you to leap across the room. The second negation functions as a dissolution of the boundaries holding you here. It is a negation of the negation, a release of the initial blockage. Feel the edges of your resistance soften. In that dissolution, movement becomes possible, not as a forced march, but as a natural flow.

#### 2.2 Exercise 1: The Container of Awareness (Let-Go of Particularity)

Begin by settling into a comfortable position, either laying down or sitting in a dignified manner. Whether your eyes are open or shut, soften your gaze. Release the subtle tensions in the face—the forehead, the jaw, the muscles around the eyes.

Turn your attention to your toes. Notice how they feel.

Now, observe the *act* of attending. To focus on your toes, your awareness must contract. It must exclude the rest of your body and the room around you. This act of focused attention is a Temporal Compression (↓).

Feel how this compression naturally creates a boundary. You have, in effect, created a conceptual container: "The Awareness of My Toes." The sensations of your toes are the contents of this container. This is the embodied basis of how we understand **Categories as Containers**. It is the first negation, the "No" that defines and limits, creating a distinct unit of experience.

Take an easy in-breath, imagining the breath traveling down into this container of awareness. Recognize the sensations within it.

As you recognize them, you may find they soften or warm. You may experience a sense of proprioceptive expansion—a sensation that feels good. If you try to *fix* the container, the sensation may slip away.

Now, let go of the focus. Allow the boundary of that container to dissolve.

This is Temporal Decompression (↑), the second negation (~~No~~). The boundary is erased. Your toes have not disappeared, but they are no longer held in a separate container. They merge back into the broader field of awareness.

##### 2.2.1 Reflection: The First Temptation and the Grounding of Collection

As you continue the exercise, your thinking mind may reassert itself. This is not a failure; it is an opportunity to observe how concepts are born from raw sensation.

> *You might think: "I am my toes." No, that's not quite right. I am more than just my toes... hmmm...I let go of my toes."*

The temptation arises to name the experience: "I am my toes." This is an attempt to solidify the container. However, you quickly realize the container is inadequate. You are not just your toes, so you cross out the name: ~~I am my toes~~.

This rhythm—contracting awareness to create a container, and expanding awareness to dissolve it—is fundamental. It is how we differentiate the world. The very basis of arithmetic—the creation of the **Unit (One)**—is found here in the capacity to isolate a region from the background. Furthermore, the **Arithmetic Is Object Collection** metaphor arises directly from this capacity. When you gather stones into a pile, you are externalizing this internal rhythm of creating, holding, and releasing bounded regions of awareness.

This move from pure feeling to a named—and then sublated—concept is the first step out of subjective immediacy. It is the rhythm I mean by "the sound of time."

*(The subsequent reflections in the original text regarding Ram Dass, "Be Here Now," and indexicals follow here.)*

#### 2.3 Exercise 2: The Construction of the Self (Forestructure Buildup)

Sinking back in... Move your awareness now to the arches of your feet. Find the 'keystone' of that arch, the point where the tension is greatest. This is a new compression, a new container. Breathe into it. On the exhalation, allow your attention and breath to spread from that keystone, radiating through your foot. Release the fixation.

Now, notice what has happened. When you were with your toes, your feet were an implicit background (a forestructure). Now, the toes and the arches are both present in a slightly different way. They have been recognized and released.

They are accumulating: I am my {toes, feet...}.

Observe the structure of this accumulation. While you are gathering these sensations (like objects in a collection), you are also integrating them. The awareness of the "foot" is now a more complex structure, constructed from the recognized parts (toes, arches).

This is the embodied basis of the **Arithmetic Is Object Construction** metaphor. Numbers are not just collections; they are wholes made up of parts that fit together in a specific structure. In The Exercise, you are experiencing embodied addition: you are fitting regions of awareness together to construct a more integrated body-feeling. Each release (↑) allows the previously fixated part (↓) to become integrated into a larger, emergent whole.

#### 2.4 Exercise 2.5 (Extension): The Geometry of Sensation

As you continue this process, moving awareness to your ankles, calves, and knees, notice the *spatiality* of the sensation.

**The Measure:** Attend to the length of your shin bone, even without visualizing it. Feel the internal distance between your knee and your ankle. This internal sense of dimension—of extension in space—is the grounding for the **Measuring Stick Metaphor**. You are using your awareness as an internal measure, laying down segments of awareness end-to-end.

**The Path:** Now, notice the *path* your awareness took. It moved sequentially from the toes, along the foot, up the ankle, to the shin. This sequential movement is the grounding for the **Arithmetic Is Motion Along a Path** metaphor. The accumulation of recognized regions is experienced as a journey through the landscape of the body. Each act of recognition is a step; the subsequent release is the movement to the next location. The growing relaxation is the distance covered from the starting point.

The accumulation of forestructures is thus fourfold: a growing Collection, an emerging Construction, an increasing Measure, and a traveled Path.

##### 2.4.1 The Excitement at the Threshold

As these forestructures accumulate in this fourfold manner, the energy builds. It feels rich, multidimensional.

The temptation arises to represent this accumulation. The mind, seeking to grasp this process, might generate pictures. You might visualize the body as a container filling up, a structure being built, or a line extending upwards from the feet (See Figure 1).

This is what Carspecken identifies as the moment where "representation is an impetus to act; here to 'act in thought'" (Carspecken, 1999, p. 172). These images—the container, the line, the constructed object—are the grounding metaphors we use to understand number. But they are not the sensation itself.

*(The reflections in the original text regarding picture thinking, von Neumann ordinals (Figure 2), and the Zeeman Catastrophe Machine (Figure 3) follow here.)*

[...] The flattening of the experience into a static picture feels inadequate. Let these images go. They are just thoughts. Return to the feeling.

#### 2.5 Exercise 3: A Single Sensation (The Unity of the Whole)

Continue the process, moving through the hips, the abdomen, the chest, the hands, arms, shoulders, and head.

You are approaching homogeneity in the body. The Construction is nearing completion; the Path has been fully traveled.

As the accumulation completes, notice the quality of the sensation. The boundaries that previously defined the "parts" (the toes, the feet, the hands) begin to dissolve. The "seams" that held the body together as a construction of distinct objects fade. You are aware not of parts fitting together, but of the whole structure itself.

The homogenized body-feeling is a single sensation. It feels lovely.

##### 2.5.1 Reflection: The Ground of Being

This moment is crucial. This unified sensation is the state *before* categorization, before counting, before measurement. It is the undifferentiated ground from which the "Things" of the world emerge. The 4Gs all rely on the general metaphor that **Numbers Are Things in the World** (collections, objects, segments, locations). But here, in the single sensation, we experience the source from which these "Things" are carved out by awareness.

*(Reflections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 from the original text follow here, discussing the dissolution of subject/object and the contradiction of desire (Figure 4).)*

[...]

The I-feeling may fuse with the body-feeling. But at that moment, a thought may arise: "I am this single sensation." Or perhaps, "I am One."

Whoops! This is the impulse to create the first container, the primary unit. It is the moment compression (↓) re-emerges from the expansive ground (↑). The sensation of unity is not the thought of that unity.

*(Section 2.5 Backsliding follows here as in the original text.)*

#### 2.6 Exercise 4: Iterate and Integrate (The Multiplicative Spiral)

You begin again. This time, you know that the desire for the grand experience—the desire for self-certainty—is itself hindering the ability to let go.

The process repeats: (i) sensation, (ii) awareness-of-sensation (compression, the creation of a container/object/measure), (iii) letting-go (decompression, the dissolution of the boundary), (iv) intensified-sensation (a richer integration).

It is not a mere circle. As Carspecken notes, "letting go is what allows the forestructures to accumulate; the implicit portions of each anticipation seem to contain more and more possibilities" (1999, p. 173).

Notice the quality of this iteration. It is not merely additive, like placing one identical block on top of another. It feels closer to a multiplicative or exponential expansion. This is the experience of iteration and growth. The **Iteration Extensions** of the 4Gs (which ground multiplication and division) are embodied here. Multiplication is not just repeated addition; it is an expansive accumulation that transforms the whole. You are not just adding more parts; you are becoming more integrated. The spiral moves upward.

### 5 Exercise 5: Reading Philosophy - Being, Nothing, and Becoming

You have been learning to navigate the rhythm of thought: compression into awareness and decompression through letting go. We can extend this embodied practice into the realm of pure abstraction, observing how the same dynamics apply, using the grounding metaphors we have just experienced.

The following extends The Exercise into a controlled abstraction experiment.

**Embodied Experiment**

Settle into the relaxed, open awareness cultivated previously. Now intentionally introduce the most abstract, contextless thought available: "Being." Attempt to fixate on it.

Feel this as an ultimate fullness—a **Container** filled to the brim, a **Construction** so complete it has no internal divisions, a **Path** extended to its limit. The felt quality is not the expansive unity of the I-feeling; it is an intense act of Temporal Compression (↓). Attention strains to grasp totality as a static object; subtle tension builds.

Yet "Being," devoid of any inner difference, is unstable. It gives nothing determinate for attention to grip. The fixation collapses. The pole flips to "Nothing."

Attempt to hold that absence. Feel this as the **Container** completely emptied, the **Collection** dispersed, the **Motion** returned entirely to the Origin (Zero). This, too, is compression: the negation of the prior abstraction.

An oscillation can now arise: "Being" collapsing into "Nothing," and back again.

Being ⇌ Nothing.

Feel this oscillation somatically. It is a movement back and forth along a path, from fullness to the origin and back again. It can also feel like a rotation around a central point, flipping between two symmetrical poles (grounding the metaphor **Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation**). This loop is restless and draining—a *bad infinite*: endless alternation without qualitative transformation.

Pause. What actually occurs *between* the poles? Shift attention away from the static poles toward that passage. Breathe into the *in between*. The movement itself—the instability in which each passes into the other—is what Hegel names **Becoming**.

To remain with Becoming, apply the earlier lesson: Let Go (LG) of fixation on the oscillation as content. This letting go is Temporal Decompression (↑). Tension releases; the grip on static abstraction loosens; the rhythm becomes becoming and the awareness of becoming. The Sound of Time returns.
