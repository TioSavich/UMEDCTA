Cognitive Structure of Classical Mathematics: Euler's Equation
Part 6 of the sources, titled "A CASE STUDY OF THE COGNITIVE STRUCTURE OF CLASSICAL MATHEMATICS," covers Case Studies 1 through 4. This section focuses on applying and integrating conceptual metaphors and blends, many introduced in earlier parts of the book, to understand complex mathematical ideas, particularly Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0). While it doesn't introduce entirely new types of algorithms, it discusses how existing or previously described algorithmic processes are understood and enabled by these conceptual structures.
Here are the metaphors and conceptual blends prominently discussed or introduced in Part 6:
Metaphors and Conceptual Blends in Part 6
1. The Functions Are Numbers Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes arithmetic operations as extending from numbers to functions, allowing functions to be metaphorically added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in a way consistent with arithmetic. This is facilitated by first conceptualizing functions as ordered pairs of points in the Cartesian plane [1-4].
2. The Trigonometry Metaphor: This metaphor is essential for conceptualizing angles as numbers, enabling arithmetic calculations on angles [5-8].
3. The Unit Circle Blend (Stage 2 and Stage 3): A conceptual blend that integrates a Euclidean circle, the Cartesian plane (with x-axis, y-axis, origin), and an angle. In Stage 2, it correlates the angle, arc length, and Cartesian coordinates. In Stage 3, it additionally incorporates a right triangle, leading to the emergence of sine and cosine functions as mathematical entities within the blend [9-12].
4. The Recurrence Is Circularity Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes recurrent phenomena in terms of circularity, particularly for understanding the periodic nature of sine and cosine functions and their properties [8, 13-15].
5. The Polar-Trigonometry Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes the Cartesian plane in terms of trigonometry, where each point (a, b) is understood as a pair of numbers (r, θ), linking distance from the origin (r) and the angle formed (θ) [16-18].
6. The Exponential Blend: This conceptual blend characterizes the one-to-one correspondence between exponentials and logarithms, mapping sums onto products and vice versa. It links sequences of integers (n) to sequences of powers (b^n) [19].
7. The Concept of e: Metaphorically, "e" is conceptualized as that number which is the base of a function that maps sums onto products and whose rate of change is identical to itself. This meaning is derived from metaphors that mathematize the concept of change [7, 20-22].
8. Numbers Are Wholes That Are Sums of Their Parts Metaphor: This metaphor, revisited from Part 3, is used here to conceptualize numbers (like 'e') as sums of their parts, crucial for understanding power series [3, 23].
9. Infinite Sums Are Limits of Infinite Sequences of Partial Sums Metaphor: This is a special case of the Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI), reiterated as fundamental for understanding power series as infinite sums of functions [3, 4].
10. The Power-Series Blend: A complex blend that integrates the ideas of numbers as wholes and parts, functions as numbers, infinite sums, infinite series, and calculus applied to power series. It allows for the conceptualization of a function as an infinite sum of other functions [4, 23-25].
11. The Multiplication-Rotation Blend: This blend (revisited from Part 4) results from the Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor, arithmetizing the 180° spatial rotation as multiplication by -1 [26-28].
12. The Rotation-Number-Line Blend: A blend formed by combining the Multiplication-Rotation blend with the Number-Line blend, where multiplication by -1 correlates with a 180° rotation on the number line [27].
13. The Rotation-Plane Blend: This blend combines the Multiplication-Rotation blend with each Number-Line blend in the Cartesian plane, creating the concept of a "rotation plane" where specific rotational inferences can be made [28, 29].
14. The 90° Rotation Metaphor: This metaphor introduces a metaphorical submapping where rotation by 90° (or π/2 radians) is conceptualized as multiplication by a number 'n' (which is later identified as 'i' or √-1). Applying this twice (two 90° rotations) corresponds to multiplication by n² (or i² = -1) [18, 29, 30].
15. The Complex Plane (conceptualized as the 90° Rotation Plane): The complex plane is understood through the structure imposed by the 90° Rotation Metaphor, establishing conceptual connections between complex numbers, geometry, and rotations [18, 30, 31].
16. Functions Are Sets of Ordered Pairs Metaphor: This metaphor (revisited from Part 4/5) redefines functions from being conceptual rules to sets of ordered pairs of real numbers, which is crucial for equating functions with identical Taylor series [32, 33].
17. The Trigonometric Complex Plane Blend: A new conceptual blend that integrates the Polar-Trigonometry Blend and the 90° Rotation-Plane Blend (the Complex Plane). It allows for the characterization of complex addition and multiplication in trigonometric terms [18, 25, 34].
18. Euler's Blend: This is the ultimate, complex conceptual blend that integrates the Power Series Blend, the Taylor Series Blend, the Exponential Complex Plane Blend, the Trigonometric Complex Plane Blend, and Sets of Ordered Pairs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ideas implicit in Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0) [25, 35].
19. Derivative Metaphor (Instantaneous Change Is Average Change over an Infinitely Small Interval): While introduced in earlier parts, it is specifically applied here to show how the derivative of the exponential function e^x is derived, linking change to rate of change [14].
Algorithms in Part 6
Part 6 does not introduce new, distinct algorithms. Instead, it demonstrates how conceptual metaphors and blends provide the cognitive structure that allows for the understanding and application of existing algorithmic processes in advanced mathematics. The discussion revolves around:
• Arithmetic calculations: How operations on numbers are extended metaphorically to functions and angles [1, 17].
• Algebraic manipulations: The use of algebraic properties and equations to derive mathematical truths [36].
• Calculation of derivatives for power series: This process, as a consequence of the properties of derivatives, is enabled by the conceptual framework of the Power-Series blend [23, 24].
• Computational aspects of proofs: The text acknowledges that proofs often involve "a lot of computation and putting together equations" [37], and that algorithmic processes are central to the "mathematics of calculation" [38].
The primary focus of Part 6, consistent with the book's overall aim, is on the cognitive and metaphorical meaning and structure that undergird these computational and algorithmic processes, rather than on detailing the algorithms themselves [7, 37, 39].

Embodied Mathematics: Metaphors and Algorithms
Part 5 of the sources, titled "IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS," covers Chapters 15 ("The Theory of Embodied Mathematics") and 16 ("The Philosophy of Embodied Mathematics") [1]. This section delves into the philosophical implications of the cognitive science of mathematics, primarily focusing on metaphors as fundamental to mathematical understanding.
Here are the metaphors and algorithms discussed in Part 5:
Metaphors in Part 5
1. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor: This metaphor, where numbers are conceptualized as points, is mentioned as an example of a deeply ingrained mathematical idea that, if taken literally, can lead to confusion (e.g., whether numbers are points or just conceptualized as such) [2]. It is also highlighted as a conceptual metaphor that brings ideas and methods of precise calculation from one domain to another [3].
2. Numbers Are Sets Metaphor: This metaphor is used as an example of how mathematicians model one branch of mathematics (arithmetic) using another (set theory). It allows forms of reasoning about sets to apply to numbers and is crucial for the classical Foundations of Mathematics program [4, 5].
3. Categories Are Containers Metaphor: This is a fundamental metaphor from everyday cognition, where a category is understood as a bounded region in space and its members as objects inside that region [6, 7]. It forms the basis for how classes and sets are conceptualized [8-15].
4. Classes Are Containers Metaphor: A specific instance of Categories Are Containers, this metaphor grounds the concept of a class in mental containers used in perception and conceptualization [14].
5. Sets Are Objects Metaphor: This metaphor allows abstract sets to be viewed as unique entities that can be members of other sets (e.g., the empty set as an entity, or power sets), moving beyond a simple container metaphor [15, 16].
6. Ordered Pair Metaphor: This metaphor defines ordered pairs in terms of sets, for instance, (a, b) as the set {{a}, {a, b}} [16-18]. It is used to reduce arithmetic to set theory [19].
7. Natural Numbers Are Sets Metaphor: This metaphor allows natural numbers to be conceptualized as sets (e.g., zero as the empty set, one as the set containing the empty set), facilitating the reduction of arithmetic to set theory. It is a linking metaphor [18-22].
8. Cantor’s Metaphor (Pairability): This is a redefinitional metaphor that provides a technical understanding of "same size as" for infinite sets, by conceptualizing two sets as having the "same size" (cardinality) if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence [21, 23-25]. It is noted as diverging from the everyday concept of "same number as" [26]. Its acceptance, along with the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, is necessary for understanding entities like $\aleph_0$ and the truth of $\aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0$ [3].
9. Sets Are Graphs Metaphor: This linking metaphor conceptualizes sets in terms of Accessible Pointed Graphs (APGs) instead of containers, modeling recursive phenomena where sets can "contain themselves" (hypersets) [13, 21, 27-31].
10. The Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI): This central conceptual metaphor is repeatedly emphasized as crucial for understanding all forms of actual infinity (e.g., infinite sets, points at infinity, limits, transfinite numbers, infinitesimals) [3, 32-38]. It maps the inferential structure of completed iterative processes onto iterative processes that go on indefinitely, metaphorically adding a "final resultant state" [33, 39, 40]. The existence of entities like a "line" in projective geometry and "truths" about them depends on this metaphor [3, 5].
11. Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor: This metaphor, along with its blend, arithmetizes the spatial rotation transformation R-180 (180-degree rotation) as the arithmetic operation of multiplication by -1 [41, 42].
12. The Formal Reduction Metaphor: This fundamental conceptual metaphor, central to formalist mathematics, provides a prescription for (1) conceptualizing any mathematical subject matter in terms of sets and (2) symbolizing it in a uniform way that meshes with formal logic [43]. It projects a set-theoretical structure onto any discretized domain of mathematics [18, 43].
• Components: Mathematical elements map onto sets, relations onto ordered n-tuples, and functions/operations onto constrained sets of ordered pairs [43].
• Interpretations: It has a "cognitive interpretation" (where mathematicians blend the subject matter with set-and-symbol structure) and a "formal foundations interpretation" (where the metaphor is taken as literally true, reducing all mathematics ontologically to set theory and logic) [44-47].
13. Spaces Are Sets of Points Metaphor: This is presented as a metaphor necessary to conceptualize geometry, topology, and calculus in discrete terms, allowing the Formal Reduction Metaphor to operate [43-45, 48]. Taking it literally implies that "points" are really members of sets, not locations [45].
14. Functions Are Ordered Pairs of Numbers Metaphor: This metaphor replaces the geometric understanding of functions as curves with the discrete concept of functions as sets of ordered pairs of real numbers [49, 50].
15. Continuity for a Line Is Numerical Gaplessness Metaphor: This metaphor redefines continuity in terms of the "gaplessness" of real numbers, rather than natural spatial intuition [49].
16. Continuity for a Function Is Preservation of Closeness Metaphor: Weierstrass's key metaphor, defining continuity via the epsilon-delta condition, replacing intuitive "drawing without lifting the pen" with an arithmetical condition [49].
17. Love Is a Journey Metaphor: This is mentioned as an example of a general-level conceptual metaphor that applies to all instances of a concept, like the grounding metaphors applying to all natural numbers [51].
18. The Essence of a Mathematical System Is an Abstract Algebraic Structure Metaphor: This metaphor links algebra to other branches of mathematics, where algebraic structures characterize the essences of mathematical systems [52-54].
19. Euler's Blend: A complex conceptual blend that unifies the ideas from power series, Taylor series, exponential complex plane, and trigonometric complex plane to provide the meaning of Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0) [50, 55, 56].
Algorithms in Part 5
The concept of algorithms is discussed more broadly in Part 5, particularly in the context of symbol manipulation and the Formal Reduction Metaphor, rather than listing specific new algorithms.
1. Algorithms for Arithmetic Operations: These are defined in terms of manipulating numerals, not numbers, allowing for efficient calculation without necessarily understanding the underlying concepts [57, 58]. They work generally for all numbers and can be implemented in computers [58].
2. Symbolic Algorithms to Mirror Rational Processes: Equivalent Result Frames (ERFs) characterizing the laws of arithmetic, combined with the numeral-number mapping, provide equations that can define purely symbolic algorithms to mirror rational processes [59-61].
3. Computable by Discrete Algorithmic Processes: A key question arising from the discretization program, particularly after Gödel's work, focuses on what mathematical problems can be solved through discrete algorithmic procedures [62, 63].
4. Mechanization of Proofs: The Formal Reduction Metaphor allows mathematical "proofs" to be symbolized and made mechanical, implying algorithmic processing of symbols [43].
5. Derivatives of Power Series: The properties of derivatives allow for the algorithmic calculation of derivatives for any power series [64].
6. Conversion Algorithms (Limits to Infinitesimals): It's noted that an algorithm can convert derivations using limits to those using infinitesimals, and vice-versa, demonstrating their algorithmic equivalence in calculus [65, 66].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Discretizing Space and Motion: The Algorithms of Modern Mathematics
Part 4 of the sources, titled "BANNING SPACE AND MOTION: THE DISCRETIZATION PROGRAM THAT SHAPED MODERN MATHEMATICS," covers Chapters 12 through 14. This section details how modern mathematics has been reshaped by the effort to conceptualize continuous phenomena in discrete, symbolic, and algorithmic terms.
Here are the metaphors and algorithms discussed in Part 4:
Metaphors in Part 4
1. A Space Is a Set of Points Metaphor: This is a central metaphor of the discretization program, which reconceptualizes naturally continuous space (e.g., a line, a plane, a 3-dimensional space) as a set with elements, where these elements are defined as points in the space. This is a consciously constructed metaphor for specific purposes, distinct from our ordinary, naturally continuous concept of space [1-11].
2. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor (non-technical/everyday version): This metaphor maps numbers onto points on an ordinary, naturally continuous line. It defines points to the left of zero as negative numbers, and distance between points as the absolute value of the numerical difference. This forms our non-technical understanding of the number line [7, 12, 13].
3. The Number-Line Blend: A conceptual blend that arises from the everyday Numbers Are Points on a Line metaphor, where numbers and points become single entities, referred to as "number-points" [48, 280(fig), 282, 295, 296, 298, 310, 393].
4. The Space-Set Blend: This is a conceptual blend between naturally continuous space (especially a line) and a set with elements. In this blend, the line is a set, and points are its members, which exist independently of the line. This blend is crucial for the discretized understanding of space [280, 282, 283(fig)].
5. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor (fully discretized version): This is a more complex metaphor building on the Space-Set Blend as its source domain. It conceptualizes numbers in terms of discretized space, with the "points" being set elements constrained by the axioms of the number system (e.g., real numbers) [12, 14].
6. A Line Is a Set of Points Metaphor: Implicitly used when conceptualizing an interval on a number line as a set of points, where each "point" is metaphorically a real number [15, 16].
7. Properties Are Functions Metaphor: This metaphor is used to replace Euclidean notions of "lack" (e.g., a line lacks breadth) with numerical values. For example, a "lack of length" is metaphorically conceptualized as the "presence of length with value zero" [17-19].
8. Infinite Nesting Property (as a generalization of the Basic Metaphor of Infinity - BMI): This property is characterized as a generalization of the BMI. It applies to concepts like nested epsilon-discs or intervals in a space, where an unending process of nesting leads to a "final resultant state" conceptualized as a single point or number [5, 6, 20, 21].
9. Continuity Is Numerical Completeness Metaphor: Dedekind's central metaphor, aiming to eliminate geometry from arithmetic. It redefines continuity in terms of the numerical "gaplessness" of the real numbers, where the real numbers (as opposed to rationals) contain no "gaps" [10, 22-25].
10. Dedekind’s Geometric Cut Metaphor: This metaphor extends the Rational-Number-Line blend to create the Real-Number-Line blend. It conceptualizes an irrational number as a "cut" in the rational-number line that has no largest rational in the lower set and no smallest rational in the upper set [26, 27].
11. Dedekind’s Arithmetic Cut Metaphor: This metaphor further abstracts Dedekind's idea by conceptualizing a real number as an ordered pair of sets of rational numbers (A, B) that fulfill certain conditions. This "reduces" the geometric notion of a cut to a purely arithmetic and set-theoretic one [27, 28].
12. Formal Foundations Metaphor: An overarching linking metaphor that conceptually "reduces" other branches of mathematics to set theory to satisfy the formal foundations program [24, 28, 29].
13. A Mathematical Function Is a Curve in the Cartesian Plane Metaphor: A central concept of the Geometric Paradigm that largely pre-dated Weierstrass's arithmetization. It visualizes functions as continuous curves in a Cartesian coordinate system [30, 31].
14. Continuity for a Line Is Numerical Gaplessness Metaphor: This metaphor (related to Dedekind's work) became a norm after Weierstrass, where the "continuity" of a line is defined by the numerical completeness of the real numbers, rather than by natural spatial intuition [10, 32].
15. Continuity for a Function Is Preservation of Closeness Metaphor (Weierstrass's Metaphorical Masterpiece): This metaphor defines the continuity of a function using the epsilon-delta condition. It replaces the intuitive idea of a function that can be drawn without lifting the pen with a precise, arithmetical condition about how "close" outputs are to each other given "close" inputs [10, 21, 32-34].
16. Functions Are Ordered Pairs of Numbers Metaphor: This metaphor replaces the geometric understanding of functions as curves with the discrete concept of functions as sets of ordered pairs of real numbers [10, 31, 35-37].
17. Infinite Sums Are Limits of Infinite Sequences of Partial Sums Metaphor: (from Part 3) This metaphor defines an infinite sum as the limit of an infinite sequence of its partial sums. It relies on the Basic Metaphor of Infinity for conceptualizing limits [38-40].
18. The Limit-Set Metaphor: This metaphor defines "The Limit of a Sequence of Sets Is the Set of the Limits of Sequences." It is used to understand phenomena like space-filling curves and the paradox of the bumpy curve problem, by treating the limit of a sequence of curves as the set of point-by-point limits [18, 19, 35, 41, 42].
19. Properties of Curves Are Functions Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes various properties of curves (e.g., area, curvature, tangent, length) as functions that map sets (representing curves) to numbers (representing the property's value) [18, 19].
20. Spatial Distance (between points a and b on a line) Is Numerical Difference (|b - a|): This metaphor defines the length of a line segment as the absolute numerical difference between its endpoints [18].
21. The Curve Length Metaphor: This metaphor defines the length of a curve as the limit of the sum of lengths of straight line segments approximating the curve. It uses the BMI to conceptualize the unending process of taking more and more, smaller segments [18, 19, 43].
22. Closeness (between two curves) Is a Number (defined by a metric): A metaphor for comparing curves in a function space by assigning a numerical "distance" based on their properties, including the behavior of their tangents [43].
23. Functions Are Points in Space Metaphor: An alternative conceptual metaphor used to understand functions as points in an abstract function space, allowing for different metrics to define "closeness" between them [44].
Algorithms in Part 4
1. The Discretization Program's Algorithmic Goal: This overarching program, which shaped modern mathematics, aimed to reconceptualize naturally continuous concepts (like space and change) in terms of discrete entities (points, numbers, symbols) to enable precise, systematic algorithmic rules for calculation [45, 46].
2. The Arithmetization Program: A component of the discretization program, it sought to fully arithmetize calculus to eliminate any notion of naturally continuous space, making calculus as precise and calculable as arithmetic, inherently relying on algorithms for numerical operations [45, 47].
3. The Formalization Program: This program sought to reconceptualize mathematics as the manipulation of discrete symbols, explicitly implying the use of algorithms for systematic symbolic operations [45].
4. Symbolic Logic's Algorithmic Aim: Symbolic logic, also part of the discretization program, aimed to discretize reason itself by using discrete symbols and precisely formulated algorithms for manipulating those symbols to derive conclusions [45].
5. Methods of Calculation in Arithmetic: These serve as the prototypical cases for "rigorous" methods in mathematics, providing certainty and precision through step-by-step algorithmic procedures that can be checked for correctness [47].
6. Epsilon-Delta Characterization of a Limit: This is presented as an algorithmic method for defining limits and continuity in purely arithmetic terms. Developed by Cauchy and completed by Weierstrass, it allows for the precise, systematic, and non-geometric definition of these concepts, enabling calculable and verifiable results [16, 25, 47, 48].
7. Conversion Algorithm (Limits to Infinitesimals): It is mentioned that an algorithm can be constructed to convert any derivation using limits to a derivation using infinitesimals, and vice-versa, highlighting the algorithmic equivalence between these two approaches to calculus [49].
8. Computable by Discrete Algorithmic Processes: A key question arising from the discretization program, especially after Gödel's work, which focuses on identifying what mathematical problems can be solved through discrete algorithmic procedures [46].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Embodiment of Infinity: Metaphors and Algorithms
Part 3 of the sources, titled "THE EMBODIMENT OF INFINITY," covers Chapters 8 through 11 [1]. This section delves into how the human cognitive system, particularly through conceptual metaphors, constructs and understands the various notions of infinity in mathematics.
Here are the metaphors and algorithms discussed in Part 3:
Metaphors in Part 3
1. Indefinite Continuous Processes Are Iterative Processes Metaphor: This metaphor allows for the conceptualization of an indefinitely continuous process as an iterative process that continues without end, yet where each iteration has a clear endpoint and a result [2].
2. The Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI): This is the central conceptual metaphor for understanding actual infinity in mathematics. It maps the inferential structure of completed iterative processes onto iterative processes that go on indefinitely. The crucial effect of the BMI is to metaphorically add a final resultant state to an unending process, thus allowing us to conceptualize infinity as a unique, completed entity (actual infinity) [3-6].
    ◦ Source Domain: Completed Iterative Processes [4]
    ◦ Target Domain: Iterative Processes That Go On And On (imperfective processes) [4]
    ◦ Key Mapping: "The final resultant state" of the completed process is mapped onto "The final resultant state (actual infinity)" of the unending process, which is conceptualized as unique and following every nonfinal state [4, 5].
    ◦ Special Cases of the BMI identified in Part 3 include: * The Highest Category Is Being Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the process of forming ascending categories, where the result of an indefinitely iterative process of higher categorization yields a highest, all-encompassing category called "Being" [7, 8]. * Infinity As a "Number" Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the integers used for enumeration, conceptualizing the unending sequence of ordered integers as "ending" with a metaphorical "$\infty$" that functions as a number for enumeration and comparison, though not for calculation [9]. * Projective Geometry: Parallel Lines Meet at Infinity: Applies the BMI to a process of forming increasingly narrow isosceles triangles, where the metaphorical "final resultant state" conceptualizes parallel lines as meeting at a "point at infinity" [6, 10, 11]. * The Infinite Set of Natural Numbers Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the unending process of generating natural numbers, conceptualizing this process as having an ultimate resultant state, which is the unique, completed infinite set of all natural numbers [12-14]. * The BMI for Generative Closure: Applies the BMI to the iterative process of repeatedly applying operations to a finite set of elements, conceptualizing the resulting "closure" as a unique final state containing every finite combination of operations [15, 16]. * Numerals for Natural Numbers (Infinite Set) Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the process of forming numerals with more and more digits, yielding a unique "set" containing all numerals for natural numbers "at infinity" [17]. * Infinite Decimals Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the unending process of adding digits after the decimal point, conceptualizing this as a completed "set" of infinite decimals that symbolize real numbers [18, 19]. * The BMI For Infinite Sequences (Prototypical Version): Characterizes the idea of a sequence approaching a limit by applying the BMI to the iterative process of generating terms of a sequence. The "final resultant state" is the unique limit L, where the metaphorical distance between terms and the limit becomes zero "at infinity" [187, 188, 189(fig), 190, 191]. * The BMI for Infinite Sequences (General Version): Extends the prototypical version to sequences that converge indirectly, using "critical elements" (teaser elements) and the concept of epsilons (decreasing differences) to characterize the approach to a limit [20-22]. * The BMI for Transfinite Ordinals ($\omega$): Applies the BMI to the unending process of generating natural numbers in their natural order, conceptualizing $\omega$ as the unique length of this infinite sequence [14, 23, 24]. * The BMI for Infinitesimal Sets: Applies the BMI to the iterative process of forming sets of numbers greater than zero and less than $1/n$, conceptualizing a unique final state as the set of infinitesimals (numbers greater than zero but less than all positive real numbers) [25, 26]. * The BMI for a Single Infinitesimal ($\delta$): A different application of the BMI used to iteratively form individual numbers $1/n$, resulting in a single infinitesimal number $\delta = 1/H$ (where H is an integer greater than all real numbers) at the metaphorical "final resultant state" [27-29].
3. Processes As Things Metaphor: This general cognitive mechanism conceptualizes abstract processes (including infinite ones) as if they were static, bounded physical objects or entities (e.g., containers, paths), allowing them to have properties like "length" or "parts" (e.g., "some infinities are bigger than others") [30]. This is linked to fictive motion [30].
4. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor: A linking metaphor that repeatedly appears, it conceptualizes numbers as point-locations on a line. In Part 3, this is crucial for understanding concepts like "distance" between terms of a sequence and its limit (as arithmetic difference) and for extending the metaphor to granular and hyperreal numbers [31-35].
5. Talmy’s Fictive Motion Schema: Used in conjunction with the Numbers Are Points on a Line metaphor and the BMI to conceptualize the idea of a sequence "approaching" a limit [32, 33].
6. Change of a Function Is the Coordinated Motion of Two Trajectors: Used as a conceptual metaphor to understand the limit of a function in terms of two entities moving in coordination [33].
7. Infinite Sums Are Limits of Infinite Sequences of Partial Sums Metaphor: This metaphor defines an infinite sum as being the limit of an infinite sequence of partial sums. It "piggybacks" on the BMI for limits of sequences [36-38].
8. The (Cantor) Pairability Metaphor: Originally introduced in Part 2, this redefinitional metaphor provides a technical understanding of "same size as" for infinite sets, by conceptualizing two sets as having the "same size" (cardinality) if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence [39-42].
9. Cantor's Ordinal Metaphor: Used to make "arithmetic sense" of infinite ordinal numbers for infinite sequences. It defines two sequences as having the "same ordinal number" if they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence [23]. This implicitly relies on the BMI to define "infinite sequence" [24].
10. Transfinite Addition (Metaphorical): The operations of addition for transfinite cardinal numbers (e.g., $\aleph_0 + \aleph_0$) and transfinite ordinal numbers (e.g., $\omega + 1$, $1 + \omega$) are described as inherently metaphorical, distinct from ordinary addition, and defined by infinite operations on sets and sequences. They also operate under different laws (e.g., the commutative law does not hold for ordinals) [43, 44].
11. Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor: This is a prior metaphor (from Part 1/2) that is brought up in Chapter 11 when discussing infinitesimals and granular numbers, as a foundational concept for understanding negative numbers and their properties on a number line [45].
12. Zooming In Is Multiplication by Infinitesimal Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes the act of visually or conceptually "zooming in" on a number line (e.g., around a real number) as being equivalent to multiplying by an infinitesimal number [28, 29].
13. Hyperreal Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor: This metaphor extends the conceptualization of numbers as points on a line to the hyperreal numbers, where the real numbers become a very sparse subset of the hyperreal line [35].
14. Instantaneous Change Is Average Change Over an Infinitely Small Interval Metaphor: Implicitly used in the conceptualization of derivatives, whether through limits (Newton) or infinitesimals (Leibniz) [46, 47].
Algorithms in Part 3
Part 3 primarily focuses on the conceptual underpinnings of infinity and the real/transfinite/infinitesimal number systems through metaphors. However, it also references the programmatic goals and conceptual methods that enable algorithmic processes within modern mathematics:
1. Epsilon-Delta Characterization of a Limit: This is presented as a method, or essentially an algorithm, for defining limits in purely arithmetic terms, thus contributing to the arithmetization of calculus [48].
2. Cantor's Rational Array Diagram/Method: This diagram illustrates a systematic procedure for constructing a sequence that includes all rational numbers, thereby demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. This systematic construction implicitly functions as an algorithm for enumerating rationals [209, 211(fig)].
3. Discretization Program's Algorithmic Goal: The broader philosophical and mathematical program of Discretization, which is a key theme of Part 3 (and Part 4), explicitly aimed to reconceptualize naturally continuous concepts (like space and change) in terms of discrete entities (points, numbers, symbols) to allow for precise, systematic algorithmic rules for calculation [49, 50].
4. Formalization Program: Closely related to discretization, this program sought to reconceptualize mathematics as the manipulation of discrete symbols, inherently implying the use of algorithms for such symbolic manipulation [49].
5. Symbolic Logic's Algorithmic Aim: Symbolic logic, as part of the discretization program, sought to discretize reason itself by using discrete symbols and precisely formulated algorithms that employed only discrete symbols [49]. This refers to the development of formal systems that allow for mechanical derivation of conclusions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algebra, Logic, and Set Theory Metaphors and Algorithms
Part 2 of the sources, titled "ALGEBRA, LOGIC, AND SETS," covers Chapters 5, 6, and 7 [1]. Here are the metaphors and algorithms listed or discussed within this section:
Metaphors in Part 2
1. Folk Theory of Essences: This is an unconscious, informal theory that most people in the Western world hold, where a category is completely characterized by a small number of essential, independent properties from which all its natural behavior flows [2-4]. This theory is central to the axiomatic method in mathematics [5-9].
2. Essence Is Form Metaphor: This metaphor, inherited from Greek philosophy, conceptualizes essence as abstract form, independent of substance. It is central to algebra, where algebraic structures characterize the essential forms of mathematical systems [4, 6, 10, 11].
3. The Essence of a Mathematical System Is an Abstract Algebraic Structure Metaphor: This implicitly assumed metaphor links algebra to other branches of mathematics, positing that abstract algebraic structures characterize the essences of mathematical systems [4, 6, 12].
4. Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra: This everyday cognitive mechanism allows for generalization in algebra. It enables reasoning about numbers or other entities without knowing their particular identities, such as in "x + 2 = 7," where 'x' stands for a role (Number) [4, 13-18].
5. Algebraic Essence (AE) Metaphors: These are conceptual mappings from algebraic structures to structures in other mathematical domains, used by mathematicians to conceptualize these other domains as having specific abstract algebraic essences [19-21].
    ◦ Addition Modulo 3 as a Commutative Group with Three Elements Metaphor: A specific AE metaphor that allows addition modulo 3 to be conceptualized in terms of an abstract algebraic structure (a commutative group with three elements) [19, 20, 22-24].
    ◦ Rotations of Equilateral Triangles as a Commutative Group with Three Elements Metaphor: Another specific AE metaphor that conceptualizes rotations of equilateral triangles as having the structure of a commutative group with three elements [20, 24, 25].
    ◦ General Form of Algebraic Essence Metaphors: A schema for these metaphors, where an algebraic structure (abstract elements, operations, identity elements, laws, and tables) is mapped to characterize the essence of a mathematical system in another domain [7, 20].
6. Classes Are Containers Metaphor: This grounding metaphor conceptualizes a class as a bounded region in space and its members as objects inside that region. This is how classes are conceptualized in everyday life and is consistent with Venn diagrams [16, 26-40].
7. Aristotle's Predication Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualized a predication like "Socrates is mortal" as a category statement, "Socrates is in the category of mortals" [30, 32, 41].
8. Boole's First-Stage Metaphor: A partial linking metaphor that maps arithmetic operations and elements (numbers, addition, multiplication, 0, 1) onto classes (classes, union, intersection, empty class, universal class), allowing classes to have an algebraic structure [31, 42-44]. This was a linking metaphor, not a grounding one [42].
9. Boole's Metaphor: This is the refined, historic metaphor that allows classes to be conceptualized as having a Boolean algebraic structure. It maps abstract elements and operations of Boolean algebra to classes, unions, intersections, complements, identity elements (0, 1), and their respective laws [16, 32-34, 39-41, 45, 46]. It also metaphorically creates an empty class and a universal class [41].
10. Propositional Logic Metaphor: A linking metaphor that conceptualizes propositions in terms of classes of world states where a proposition is true. This maps the elements and operations of Boole's algebra of classes onto propositional logic (propositions, disjunction, conjunction, negation, implication, equivalence, contradictions, tautologies) [32, 33, 47-50].
11. Sets Are Objects Metaphor: This metaphor allows abstract sets to be viewed as unique entities in their own right, which can also be members of other sets (e.g., the empty set as an entity, or power sets) [51]. This is crucial for creating more complex set-theoretical constructions.
12. Ordered Pair Metaphor: This metaphor defines ordered pairs in terms of sets. Intuitively, ordered pairs are structured by a Path schema (first member as source, second as goal), but metaphorically defined as specific sets, e.g., the set {{a}, {a, b}} for the ordered pair (a, b) [16, 51-53].
13. Natural Numbers Are Sets Metaphor: This linking metaphor, exemplified by John von Neumann's work, allows natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) to be conceptualized metaphorically as sets containing other sets (e.g., zero as the empty set, one as the set containing the empty set, etc.). This metaphor is used to reduce arithmetic to set theory [16, 52, 54-59].
14. Cantor's Metaphor: This redefinitional metaphor provides a technical understanding of "same size as" for infinite sets, by conceptualizing two sets as having the "same size" (cardinality) if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence (pairability). This diverges from the everyday concept of "same number as" [16, 37, 40, 55, 60-65].
15. Sets Are Graphs Metaphor: This linking metaphor conceptualizes sets in terms of Accessible Pointed Graphs (APGs) instead of containers, allowing for the modeling of recursive phenomena (hypersets) where sets can metaphorically "contain themselves" [147, 148, 149(fig), 150, 152].
16. Formal Foundations Metaphor: This overarching linking metaphor is needed conceptually to "reduce" other branches of mathematics to set theory in order to satisfy the Formal Foundations program [54, 66].
Algorithms in Part 2
While Part 2 primarily focuses on metaphors structuring mathematical ideas, the concept of algorithms for symbolic manipulation is discussed in the context of Boole's work and symbolic logic:
• Algorithms for Arithmetic Operations: Defined in terms of numerals, not numbers, these algorithms enable the correct manipulation of symbols (numerals) for efficient calculation without requiring an understanding of the underlying numbers. They work generally for all numbers and can be implemented in computers [67-71].
• Mechanization of Propositional Calculus: Through a series of metaphorical and symbolic mappings (from Container schemas to classes, to propositional logic, and finally to symbols), propositional calculus can be mechanized. This results in "blind" rules for symbol manipulation that "preserve truth," allowing for purely mechanical derivation of conclusions [49, 70].

Metaphors and Algorithms for Mathematical Concepts
Here are the metaphors and algorithms listed in Part 1 of the sources, which covers Chapters 1 through 4, along with relevant introductory material from the preface:
Metaphors in Part 1
1. Conceptual Metaphor:
    ◦ This is a fundamental cognitive mechanism where abstract concepts are conceptualized in concrete terms, using ideas and modes of reasoning grounded in the sensory-motor system [1]. It is a grounded, inference-preserving cross-domain mapping—a neural mechanism that allows using the inferential structure of one conceptual domain (e.g., geometry) to reason about another (e.g., arithmetic) [2]. Conceptual metaphor is central to extending basic arithmetic to more sophisticated applications of number and structures mathematics as human beings conceptualize it [3, 4].
    ◦ General examples of inherently metaphorical mathematical ideas mentioned in the introductory context include: * The number line, where numbers are conceptualized metaphorically as points on a line [5, 6]. This is also presented as a linking metaphor [7]. * Boole’s algebra of classes, where the formation of classes of objects is conceptualized metaphorically in terms of algebraic operations and elements (plus, times, zero, one, and so on) [5]. * Symbolic logic, where reasoning is conceptualized metaphorically as mathematical calculation using symbols [5]. * Trigonometric functions, where angles are conceptualized metaphorically as numbers [5, 8]. * The complex plane, where multiplication is conceptualized metaphorically in terms of rotation [8].
2. States Are Locations (also named States Are Bounded Regions in Space): This metaphor allows abstract states to be understood in terms of physical locations or bounded regions, as in the expression "I’m in a depression" [9, 10].
3. Categories Are Containers Metaphor: This metaphor helps understand a category as a bounded region in space and members of the category as objects inside that bounded region [11]. This metaphor, like others, preserves the inferential structure of its source domain [12].
4. Conceptualizing Technical Mathematical Concepts using Everyday Concepts [13, 14]:
    ◦ Conceptualizing the technical mathematical concept of a class makes use of the everyday concept of a collection of objects in a bounded region of space [13].
    ◦ Conceptualizing the technical mathematical concept of recursion makes use of the everyday concept of a repeated action [13].
    ◦ Conceptualizing the technical mathematical concept of complex arithmetic makes use of the everyday concept of rotation [13].
    ◦ Conceptualizing derivatives in calculus requires making use of such everyday concepts as motion, approaching a boundary, and so on [14].
5. Grounding Metaphors: These are conceptual metaphors that allow us to project from everyday experiences (like putting things into piles) onto abstract concepts (like addition) [15]. They yield basic, directly grounded ideas that usually require little instruction [16]. The four basic grounding metaphors for arithmetic are referred to as the 4Gs [17, 18].
6. Linking Metaphors: These conceptual metaphors link arithmetic to other branches of mathematics, for example, conceptualizing arithmetic in spatial terms [15]. They yield sophisticated ideas, sometimes called abstract ideas, that require significant explicit instruction [7].
7. Arithmetic Is Object Collection Metaphor:
    ◦ This is a grounding metaphor that conceptualizes arithmetic operations through the act of collecting or grouping physical objects [19, 20].
    ◦ Key Mappings: Collections of objects of the same size → Numbers; The size of the collection → The size of the number; Bigger → Greater; Smaller → Less; The smallest collection → The unit (One); Putting collections together → Addition; Taking a smaller collection from a larger collection → Subtraction [20].
    ◦ Extensions: * The Pooling/Splitting Extension: Maps the pooling of subcollections to multiplication, and the splitting of a collection to division [21]. * The Iteration Extension: Maps the repeated addition of collections to multiplication, and the repeated subtraction of collections to division [22].
8. Arithmetic Is Object Construction Metaphor:
    ◦ This grounding metaphor conceptualizes numbers as wholes made up of parts, where arithmetic operations provide the patterns for how these parts fit together [23, 24].
    ◦ Key Mappings: Wholes → Wholes; Parts → Parts; Putting objects together → Addition; Taking smaller objects from larger objects to form other objects → Subtraction [25].
    ◦ Extensions: * The Fitting Together/Splitting Up Extension: Maps the fitting together of parts to multiplication, and the splitting up of a whole object into parts to division [25, 26]. * The Iteration Extension: Maps the repeated addition of parts to multiplication, and the repeated subtraction of parts to division [26]. * Fractions: Conceptualizes simple (1/n) and complex (m/n) fractions in terms of parts of a unit object [27].
9. The Measuring Stick Metaphor:
    ◦ This grounding metaphor conceptualizes numbers and arithmetic operations in terms of using a physical measuring stick or string (physical segments) [28, 29].
    ◦ Key Mappings: Ultimate parts of unit length → Numbers; The basic physical segment → One; The length of the physical segment → The size of the number; Longer → Greater; Shorter → Less; Acts of physical segment placement → Arithmetic operations; A physical segment → The result of an arithmetic operation; Putting physical segments together end-to-end → Addition; Taking shorter physical segments from larger → Subtraction [29, 30].
    ◦ Extensions: * The Fitting Together/Dividing Up Extension: Maps the fitting together of segments of certain lengths to multiplication, and the splitting up of a segment to division [30, 31]. * The Iteration Extension: Maps the repeated addition of segments to multiplication, and the repeated subtraction of segments to division [31, 32]. * Fractions: Conceptualizes simple (1/n) and complex (m/n) fractions in terms of parts of a physical segment [32].
10. Arithmetic Is Motion Along a Path Metaphor:
• This grounding metaphor conceptualizes numbers and arithmetic operations in terms of motion along a path [33, 34].
• Key Mappings: Acts of moving along the path → Arithmetic operations; A point-location on the path → The result of an arithmetic operation; The origin → Zero; Point-locations on a path → Numbers; The unit location → One; Further from the origin → Greater than; Closer to the origin → Less than; Moving from A away from the origin a distance B → Addition of B to A; Moving toward the origin from A a distance B → Subtraction of B from A [34, 35].
• Extensions: * The Iteration Extension: Maps moving a certain distance a certain number of times to multiplication, and repeated movement toward the origin to division [35, 36]. * Fractions: Conceptualizes simple (1/n) and complex (m/n) fractions as specific point-locations reached through motion [36].
11. Numbers Are Things in the World Metaphor: This is a more general metaphor induced by the four grounding metaphors (the 4Gs), where numbers are conceptualized as physical entities that exist in the world (e.g., collections, objects, segments, locations) [37].
12. Numbers are sums of products of other numbers: This metaphor underlies the conceptualization of numbers in base-defined numeral systems (e.g., decimal, binary, octal), where a number is seen as a sum of integers times powers of a base [38, 39].
13. Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor: This metaphor extends the grounding metaphors by conceptualizing multiplication by -1 as a spatial rotation to a symmetrical point [40, 41].
Algorithms in Part 1
1. Algorithms for Arithmetic Operations:
    ◦ Definition: These are defined in terms of numerals, not numbers, allowing for the correct manipulation of symbols without necessarily understanding the underlying numbers [42].
    ◦ Purpose: They are explicitly created for efficient calculation and work generally for all numbers, regardless of size [42, 43]. They can be implemented in physical machines, such as computers, to perform calculations perfectly without understanding [43].
    ◦ Mechanisms: These algorithms are built upon Equivalent Result Frames (ERFs) that are true of physical source domains, the four grounding metaphors (4Gs) that map these ERFs onto arithmetic, and the numeral-number mapping that translates arithmetic ERFs into symbolic equations [44].

Cognitive Foundations of Mathematics
2 sources
This extensive text, "Where Mathematics Comes From," explores the cognitive foundations of mathematical ideas, arguing that mathematics is grounded in human embodiment, brain structure, and everyday experience, rather than existing as abstract, transcendent truths. Authors George Lakoff and Rafael Núñez, drawing on cognitive science, demonstrate how conceptual metaphors and blends extend innate arithmetic abilities to complex mathematical concepts like infinity, real numbers, and calculus. The work challenges traditional views, such as mathematical Platonism, by illustrating how even advanced mathematical structures, like Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0), are understood through a network of embodied metaphors. It emphasizes that mathematics is a product of the human imagination and culture, evolving through historical events and cognitive mechanisms that bridge sensory-motor experience with abstract thought. Ultimately, the book positions mathematics as a profound human endeavor accessible to scientific study, revealing the cognitive processes that shape its understanding and development.

Part 2 of the sources, titled "ALGEBRA, LOGIC, AND SETS," covers Chapters 5, 6, and 7. Here are the metaphors and algorithms listed or discussed within this section:
Metaphors in Part 2
1. Folk Theory of Essences: This is an unconscious, informal theory that most people in the Western world hold, where a category is completely characterized by a small number of essential, independent properties from which all its natural behavior flows. This theory is central to the axiomatic method in mathematics.
2. Essence Is Form Metaphor: This metaphor, inherited from Greek philosophy, conceptualizes essence as abstract form, independent of substance. It is central to algebra, where algebraic structures characterize the essential forms of mathematical systems.

What are all the metaphors and algorithms in part 3?

Part 3 of the sources, titled "THE EMBODIMENT OF INFINITY," covers Chapters 8 through 11. This section delves into how the human cognitive system, particularly through conceptual metaphors, constructs and understands the various notions of infinity in mathematics.
Here are the metaphors and algorithms discussed in Part 3:
Metaphors in Part 3
1. Indefinite Continuous Processes Are Iterative Processes Metaphor: This metaphor allows for the conceptualization of an indefinitely continuous process as an iterative process that continues without end, yet where each iteration has a clear endpoint and a result.
2. The Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI): This is the central conceptual metaphor for understanding actual infinity in mathematics. It maps the inferential structure of completed iterative processes onto iterative processes that go on indefinitely. The crucial effect of the BMI is to metaphorically add a final resultant state to an unending process, thus allowing us to conceptualize infinity as a unique, completed entity (actual infinity).
    ◦ Source Domain: Completed Iterative Processes
    ◦ Target Domain: Iterative Processes That Go On And On (imperfective processes)
    ◦ Key Mapping: "The final resultant state" of the completed process is mapped onto "The final resultant state (actual infinity)" of the unending process, which is conceptualized as unique and following every nonfinal state.
    ◦ Special Cases of the BMI identified in Part 3 include:
        ▪ The Highest Category Is Being Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the process of forming ascending categories, where the result of an indefinitely iterative process of higher categorization yields a highest, all-encompassing category called "Being".
        ▪ Infinity As a "Number" Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the integers used for enumeration, conceptualizing the unending sequence of ordered integers as "ending" with a metaphorical "$\infty$" that functions as a number for enumeration and comparison, though not for calculation.
        ▪ Projective Geometry: Parallel Lines Meet at Infinity: Applies the BMI to a process of forming increasingly narrow isosceles triangles, where the metaphorical "final resultant state" conceptualizes parallel lines as meeting at a "point at infinity".
        ▪ The Infinite Set of Natural Numbers Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the unending process of generating natural numbers, conceptualizing this process as having an ultimate resultant state, which is the unique, completed infinite set of all natural numbers.
        ▪ The BMI for Generative Closure: Applies the BMI to the iterative process of repeatedly applying operations to a finite set of elements, conceptualizing the resulting "closure" as a unique final state containing every finite combination of operations.
        ▪ Numerals for Natural Numbers (Infinite Set) Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the process of forming numerals with more and more digits, yielding a unique "set" containing all numerals for natural numbers "at infinity".
        ▪ Infinite Decimals Metaphor: Applies the BMI to the unending process of adding digits after the decimal point, conceptualizing this as a completed "set" of infinite decimals that symbolize real numbers.
        ▪ The BMI For Infinite Sequences (Prototypical Version): Characterizes the idea of a sequence approaching a limit by applying the BMI to the iterative process of generating terms of a sequence. The "final resultant state" is the unique limit L, where the metaphorical distance between terms and the limit becomes zero "at infinity" [187, 188, 189(fig), 190, 191].
        ▪ The BMI for Infinite Sequences (General Version): Extends the prototypical version to sequences that converge indirectly, using "critical elements" (teaser elements) and the concept of epsilons (decreasing differences) to characterize the approach to a limit.
        ▪ The BMI for Transfinite Ordinals ($\omega$): Applies the BMI to the unending process of generating natural numbers in their natural order, conceptualizing $\omega$ as the unique length of this infinite sequence.
        ▪ The BMI for Infinitesimal Sets: Applies the BMI to the iterative process of forming sets of numbers greater than zero and less than $1/n$, conceptualizing a unique final state as the set of infinitesimals (numbers greater than zero but less than all positive real numbers).
        ▪ The BMI for a Single Infinitesimal ($\delta$): A different application of the BMI used to iteratively form individual numbers $1/n$, resulting in a single infinitesimal number $\delta = 1/H$ (where H is an integer greater than all real numbers) at the metaphorical "final resultant state".
3. Processes As Things Metaphor: This general cognitive mechanism conceptualizes abstract processes (including infinite ones) as if they were static, bounded physical objects or entities (e.g., containers, paths), allowing them to have properties like "length" or "parts" (e.g., "some infinities are bigger than others"). This is linked to fictive motion.
4. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor: A linking metaphor that repeatedly appears, it conceptualizes numbers as point-locations on a line. In Part 3, this is crucial for understanding concepts like "distance" between terms of a sequence and its limit (as arithmetic difference) and for extending the metaphor to granular and hyperreal numbers.
5. Talmy’s Fictive Motion Schema: Used in conjunction with the Numbers Are Points on a Line metaphor and the BMI to conceptualize the idea of a sequence "approaching" a limit.
6. Change of a Function Is the Coordinated Motion of Two Trajectors: Used as a conceptual metaphor to understand the limit of a function in terms of two entities moving in coordination.
7. Infinite Sums Are Limits of Infinite Sequences of Partial Sums Metaphor: This metaphor defines an infinite sum as being the limit of an infinite sequence of partial sums. It "piggybacks" on the BMI for limits of sequences.
8. The (Cantor) Pairability Metaphor: Originally introduced in Part 2, this redefinitional metaphor provides a technical understanding of "same size as" for infinite sets, by conceptualizing two sets as having the "same size" (cardinality) if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence.
9. Cantor's Ordinal Metaphor: Used to make "arithmetic sense" of infinite ordinal numbers for infinite sequences. It defines two sequences as having the "same ordinal number" if they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence. This implicitly relies on the BMI to define "infinite sequence".
10. Transfinite Addition (Metaphorical): The operations of addition for transfinite cardinal numbers (e.g., $\aleph_0 + \aleph_0$) and transfinite ordinal numbers (e.g., $\omega + 1$, $1 + \omega$) are described as inherently metaphorical, distinct from ordinary addition, and defined by infinite operations on sets and sequences. They also operate under different laws (e.g., the commutative law does not hold for ordinals).
11. Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor: This is a prior metaphor (from Part 1/2) that is brought up in Chapter 11 when discussing infinitesimals and granular numbers, as a foundational concept for understanding negative numbers and their properties on a number line.
12. Zooming In Is Multiplication by Infinitesimal Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes the act of visually or conceptually "zooming in" on a number line (e.g., around a real number) as being equivalent to multiplying by an infinitesimal number.
13. Hyperreal Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor: This metaphor extends the conceptualization of numbers as points on a line to the hyperreal numbers, where the real numbers become a very sparse subset of the hyperreal line.
14. Instantaneous Change Is Average Change Over an Infinitely Small Interval Metaphor: Implicitly used in the conceptualization of derivatives, whether through limits (Newton) or infinitesimals (Leibniz).
Algorithms in Part 3
Part 3 primarily focuses on the conceptual underpinnings of infinity and the real/transfinite/infinitesimal number systems through metaphors. However, it also references the programmatic goals and conceptual methods that enable algorithmic processes within modern mathematics:
1. Epsilon-Delta Characterization of a Limit: This is presented as a method, or essentially an algorithm, for defining limits in purely arithmetic terms, thus contributing to the arithmetization of calculus.
2. Cantor's Rational Array Diagram/Method: This diagram illustrates a systematic procedure for constructing a sequence that includes all rational numbers, thereby demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. This systematic construction implicitly functions as an algorithm for enumerating rationals [209, 211(fig)].
3. Discretization Program's Algorithmic Goal: The broader philosophical and mathematical program of Discretization, which is a key theme of Part 3 (and Part 4), explicitly aimed to reconceptualize naturally continuous concepts (like space and change) in terms of discrete entities (points, numbers, symbols) to allow for precise, systematic algorithmic rules for calculation.
4. Formalization Program: Closely related to discretization, this program sought to reconceptualize mathematics as the manipulation of discrete symbols, inherently implying the use of algorithms for such symbolic manipulation.
5. Symbolic Logic's Algorithmic Aim: Symbolic logic, as part of the discretization program, sought to discretize reason itself by using discrete symbols and precisely formulated algorithms that employed only discrete symbols. This refers to the development of formal systems that allow for mechanical derivation of conclusions.
What are all the metaphors and algorithms in part 4?

Part 4 of the sources, titled "BANNING SPACE AND MOTION: THE DISCRETIZATION PROGRAM THAT SHAPED MODERN MATHEMATICS," covers Chapters 12 through 14. This section details how modern mathematics has been reshaped by the effort to conceptualize continuous phenomena in discrete, symbolic, and algorithmic terms.
Here are the metaphors and algorithms discussed in Part 4:
Metaphors in Part 4
1. A Space Is a Set of Points Metaphor: This is a central metaphor of the discretization program, which reconceptualizes naturally continuous space (e.g., a line, a plane, a 3-dimensional space) as a set with elements, where these elements are defined as points in the space. This is a consciously constructed metaphor for specific purposes, distinct from our ordinary, naturally continuous concept of space.
2. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor (non-technical/everyday version): This metaphor maps numbers onto points on an ordinary, naturally continuous line. It defines points to the left of zero as negative numbers, and distance between points as the absolute value of the numerical difference. This forms our non-technical understanding of the number line.
3. The Number-Line Blend: A conceptual blend that arises from the everyday Numbers Are Points on a Line metaphor, where numbers and points become single entities, referred to as "number-points" [48, 280(fig), 282, 295, 296, 298, 310, 393].
4. The Space-Set Blend: This is a conceptual blend between naturally continuous space (especially a line) and a set with elements. In this blend, the line is a set, and points are its members, which exist independently of the line. This blend is crucial for the discretized understanding of space [280, 282, 283(fig)].
5. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor (fully discretized version): This is a more complex metaphor building on the Space-Set Blend as its source domain. It conceptualizes numbers in terms of discretized space, with the "points" being set elements constrained by the axioms of the number system (e.g., real numbers).
6. A Line Is a Set of Points Metaphor: Implicitly used when conceptualizing an interval on a number line as a set of points, where each "point" is metaphorically a real number.
7. Properties Are Functions Metaphor: This metaphor is used to replace Euclidean notions of "lack" (e.g., a line lacks breadth) with numerical values. For example, a "lack of length" is metaphorically conceptualized as the "presence of length with value zero".
8. Infinite Nesting Property (as a generalization of the Basic Metaphor of Infinity - BMI): This property is characterized as a generalization of the BMI. It applies to concepts like nested epsilon-discs or intervals in a space, where an unending process of nesting leads to a "final resultant state" conceptualized as a single point or number.
9. Continuity Is Numerical Completeness Metaphor: Dedekind's central metaphor, aiming to eliminate geometry from arithmetic. It redefines continuity in terms of the numerical "gaplessness" of the real numbers, where the real numbers (as opposed to rationals) contain no "gaps".
10. Dedekind’s Geometric Cut Metaphor: This metaphor extends the Rational-Number-Line blend to create the Real-Number-Line blend. It conceptualizes an irrational number as a "cut" in the rational-number line that has no largest rational in the lower set and no smallest rational in the upper set.
11. Dedekind’s Arithmetic Cut Metaphor: This metaphor further abstracts Dedekind's idea by conceptualizing a real number as an ordered pair of sets of rational numbers (A, B) that fulfill certain conditions. This "reduces" the geometric notion of a cut to a purely arithmetic and set-theoretic one.
12. Formal Foundations Metaphor: An overarching linking metaphor that conceptually "reduces" other branches of mathematics to set theory to satisfy the formal foundations program.
13. A Mathematical Function Is a Curve in the Cartesian Plane Metaphor: A central concept of the Geometric Paradigm that largely pre-dated Weierstrass's arithmetization. It visualizes functions as continuous curves in a Cartesian coordinate system.
14. Continuity for a Line Is Numerical Gaplessness Metaphor: This metaphor (related to Dedekind's work) became a norm after Weierstrass, where the "continuity" of a line is defined by the numerical completeness of the real numbers, rather than by natural spatial intuition.
15. Continuity for a Function Is Preservation of Closeness Metaphor (Weierstrass's Metaphorical Masterpiece): This metaphor defines the continuity of a function using the epsilon-delta condition. It replaces the intuitive idea of a function that can be drawn without lifting the pen with a precise, arithmetical condition about how "close" outputs are to each other given "close" inputs.
16. Functions Are Ordered Pairs of Numbers Metaphor: This metaphor replaces the geometric understanding of functions as curves with the discrete concept of functions as sets of ordered pairs of real numbers.
17. Infinite Sums Are Limits of Infinite Sequences of Partial Sums Metaphor: (from Part 3) This metaphor defines an infinite sum as the limit of an infinite sequence of its partial sums. It relies on the Basic Metaphor of Infinity for conceptualizing limits.
18. The Limit-Set Metaphor: This metaphor defines "The Limit of a Sequence of Sets Is the Set of the Limits of Sequences." It is used to understand phenomena like space-filling curves and the paradox of the bumpy curve problem, by treating the limit of a sequence of curves as the set of point-by-point limits.
19. Properties of Curves Are Functions Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes various properties of curves (e.g., area, curvature, tangent, length) as functions that map sets (representing curves) to numbers (representing the property's value).
20. Spatial Distance (between points a and b on a line) Is Numerical Difference (|b - a|): This metaphor defines the length of a line segment as the absolute numerical difference between its endpoints.
21. The Curve Length Metaphor: This metaphor defines the length of a curve as the limit of the sum of lengths of straight line segments approximating the curve. It uses the BMI to conceptualize the unending process of taking more and more, smaller segments.
22. Closeness (between two curves) Is a Number (defined by a metric): A metaphor for comparing curves in a function space by assigning a numerical "distance" based on their properties, including the behavior of their tangents.
23. Functions Are Points in Space Metaphor: An alternative conceptual metaphor used to understand functions as points in an abstract function space, allowing for different metrics to define "closeness" between them.
Algorithms in Part 4
1. The Discretization Program's Algorithmic Goal: This overarching program, which shaped modern mathematics, aimed to reconceptualize naturally continuous concepts (like space and change) in terms of discrete entities (points, numbers, symbols) to enable precise, systematic algorithmic rules for calculation.
2. The Arithmetization Program: A component of the discretization program, it sought to fully arithmetize calculus to eliminate any notion of naturally continuous space, making calculus as precise and calculable as arithmetic, inherently relying on algorithms for numerical operations.
3. The Formalization Program: This program sought to reconceptualize mathematics as the manipulation of discrete symbols, explicitly implying the use of algorithms for systematic symbolic operations.
4. Symbolic Logic's Algorithmic Aim: Symbolic logic, also part of the discretization program, aimed to discretize reason itself by using discrete symbols and precisely formulated algorithms for manipulating those symbols to derive conclusions.
5. Methods of Calculation in Arithmetic: These serve as the prototypical cases for "rigorous" methods in mathematics, providing certainty and precision through step-by-step algorithmic procedures that can be checked for correctness.
6. Epsilon-Delta Characterization of a Limit: This is presented as an algorithmic method for defining limits and continuity in purely arithmetic terms. Developed by Cauchy and completed by Weierstrass, it allows for the precise, systematic, and non-geometric definition of these concepts, enabling calculable and verifiable results.
7. Conversion Algorithm (Limits to Infinitesimals): It is mentioned that an algorithm can be constructed to convert any derivation using limits to a derivation using infinitesimals, and vice-versa, highlighting the algorithmic equivalence between these two approaches to calculus.
8. Computable by Discrete Algorithmic Processes: A key question arising from the discretization program, especially after Gödel's work, which focuses on identifying what mathematical problems can be solved through discrete algorithmic procedures.
What are all the metaphors and algorithms in part 5?

Part 5 of the sources, titled "IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS," covers Chapters 15 ("The Theory of Embodied Mathematics") and 16 ("The Philosophy of Embodied Mathematics"). This section delves into the philosophical implications of the cognitive science of mathematics, primarily focusing on metaphors as fundamental to mathematical understanding.
Here are the metaphors and algorithms discussed in Part 5:
Metaphors in Part 5
1. Numbers Are Points on a Line Metaphor: This metaphor, where numbers are conceptualized as points, is mentioned as an example of a deeply ingrained mathematical idea that, if taken literally, can lead to confusion (e.g., whether numbers are points or just conceptualized as such). It is also highlighted as a conceptual metaphor that brings ideas and methods of precise calculation from one domain to another.
2. Numbers Are Sets Metaphor: This metaphor is used as an example of how mathematicians model one branch of mathematics (arithmetic) using another (set theory). It allows forms of reasoning about sets to apply to numbers and is crucial for the classical Foundations of Mathematics program.
3. Categories Are Containers Metaphor: This is a fundamental metaphor from everyday cognition, where a category is understood as a bounded region in space and its members as objects inside that region. It forms the basis for how classes and sets are conceptualized.
4. Classes Are Containers Metaphor: A specific instance of Categories Are Containers, this metaphor grounds the concept of a class in mental containers used in perception and conceptualization.
5. Sets Are Objects Metaphor: This metaphor allows abstract sets to be viewed as unique entities that can be members of other sets (e.g., the empty set as an entity, or power sets), moving beyond a simple container metaphor.
6. Ordered Pair Metaphor: This metaphor defines ordered pairs in terms of sets, for instance, (a, b) as the set {{a}, {a, b}}. It is used to reduce arithmetic to set theory.
7. Natural Numbers Are Sets Metaphor: This metaphor allows natural numbers to be conceptualized as sets (e.g., zero as the empty set, one as the set containing the empty set), facilitating the reduction of arithmetic to set theory. It is a linking metaphor.
8. Cantor’s Metaphor (Pairability): This is a redefinitional metaphor that provides a technical understanding of "same size as" for infinite sets, by conceptualizing two sets as having the "same size" (cardinality) if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence. It is noted as diverging from the everyday concept of "same number as". Its acceptance, along with the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, is necessary for understanding entities like $\aleph_0$ and the truth of $\aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0$.
9. Sets Are Graphs Metaphor: This linking metaphor conceptualizes sets in terms of Accessible Pointed Graphs (APGs) instead of containers, modeling recursive phenomena where sets can "contain themselves" (hypersets).
10. The Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI): This central conceptual metaphor is repeatedly emphasized as crucial for understanding all forms of actual infinity (e.g., infinite sets, points at infinity, limits, transfinite numbers, infinitesimals). It maps the inferential structure of completed iterative processes onto iterative processes that go on indefinitely, metaphorically adding a "final resultant state". The existence of entities like a "line" in projective geometry and "truths" about them depends on this metaphor.
11. Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor: This metaphor, along with its blend, arithmetizes the spatial rotation transformation R-180 (180-degree rotation) as the arithmetic operation of multiplication by -1.
12. The Formal Reduction Metaphor: This fundamental conceptual metaphor, central to formalist mathematics, provides a prescription for (1) conceptualizing any mathematical subject matter in terms of sets and (2) symbolizing it in a uniform way that meshes with formal logic. It projects a set-theoretical structure onto any discretized domain of mathematics.
    ◦ Components: Mathematical elements map onto sets, relations onto ordered n-tuples, and functions/operations onto constrained sets of ordered pairs.
    ◦ Interpretations: It has a "cognitive interpretation" (where mathematicians blend the subject matter with set-and-symbol structure) and a "formal foundations interpretation" (where the metaphor is taken as literally true, reducing all mathematics ontologically to set theory and logic).
13. Spaces Are Sets of Points Metaphor: This is presented as a metaphor necessary to conceptualize geometry, topology, and calculus in discrete terms, allowing the Formal Reduction Metaphor to operate. Taking it literally implies that "points" are really members of sets, not locations.
14. Functions Are Ordered Pairs of Numbers Metaphor: This metaphor replaces the geometric understanding of functions as curves with the discrete concept of functions as sets of ordered pairs of real numbers.
15. Continuity for a Line Is Numerical Gaplessness Metaphor: This metaphor redefines continuity in terms of the "gaplessness" of real numbers, rather than natural spatial intuition.
16. Continuity for a Function Is Preservation of Closeness Metaphor: Weierstrass's key metaphor, defining continuity via the epsilon-delta condition, replacing intuitive "drawing without lifting the pen" with an arithmetical condition.
17. Love Is a Journey Metaphor: This is mentioned as an example of a general-level conceptual metaphor that applies to all instances of a concept, like the grounding metaphors applying to all natural numbers.
18. The Essence of a Mathematical System Is an Abstract Algebraic Structure Metaphor: This metaphor links algebra to other branches of mathematics, where algebraic structures characterize the essences of mathematical systems.
19. Euler's Blend: A complex conceptual blend that unifies the ideas from power series, Taylor series, exponential complex plane, and trigonometric complex plane to provide the meaning of Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0).
Algorithms in Part 5
The concept of algorithms is discussed more broadly in Part 5, particularly in the context of symbol manipulation and the Formal Reduction Metaphor, rather than listing specific new algorithms.
1. Algorithms for Arithmetic Operations: These are defined in terms of manipulating numerals, not numbers, allowing for efficient calculation without necessarily understanding the underlying concepts. They work generally for all numbers and can be implemented in computers.
2. Symbolic Algorithms to Mirror Rational Processes: Equivalent Result Frames (ERFs) characterizing the laws of arithmetic, combined with the numeral-number mapping, provide equations that can define purely symbolic algorithms to mirror rational processes.
3. Computable by Discrete Algorithmic Processes: A key question arising from the discretization program, particularly after Gödel's work, focuses on what mathematical problems can be solved through discrete algorithmic procedures.
4. Mechanization of Proofs: The Formal Reduction Metaphor allows mathematical "proofs" to be symbolized and made mechanical, implying algorithmic processing of symbols.
5. Derivatives of Power Series: The properties of derivatives allow for the algorithmic calculation of derivatives for any power series.
6. Conversion Algorithms (Limits to Infinitesimals): It's noted that an algorithm can convert derivations using limits to those using infinitesimals, and vice-versa, demonstrating their algorithmic equivalence in calculus.
Any new metaphors or algorithms in part 6?

Part 6 of the sources, titled "A CASE STUDY OF THE COGNITIVE STRUCTURE OF CLASSICAL MATHEMATICS," covers Case Studies 1 through 4. This section focuses on applying and integrating conceptual metaphors and blends, many introduced in earlier parts of the book, to understand complex mathematical ideas, particularly Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0). While it doesn't introduce entirely new types of algorithms, it discusses how existing or previously described algorithmic processes are understood and enabled by these conceptual structures.
Here are the metaphors and conceptual blends prominently discussed or introduced in Part 6:
Metaphors and Conceptual Blends in Part 6
1. The Functions Are Numbers Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes arithmetic operations as extending from numbers to functions, allowing functions to be metaphorically added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in a way consistent with arithmetic. This is facilitated by first conceptualizing functions as ordered pairs of points in the Cartesian plane.
2. The Trigonometry Metaphor: This metaphor is essential for conceptualizing angles as numbers, enabling arithmetic calculations on angles.
3. The Unit Circle Blend (Stage 2 and Stage 3): A conceptual blend that integrates a Euclidean circle, the Cartesian plane (with x-axis, y-axis, origin), and an angle. In Stage 2, it correlates the angle, arc length, and Cartesian coordinates. In Stage 3, it additionally incorporates a right triangle, leading to the emergence of sine and cosine functions as mathematical entities within the blend.
4. The Recurrence Is Circularity Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes recurrent phenomena in terms of circularity, particularly for understanding the periodic nature of sine and cosine functions and their properties.
5. The Polar-Trigonometry Metaphor: This metaphor conceptualizes the Cartesian plane in terms of trigonometry, where each point (a, b) is understood as a pair of numbers (r, θ), linking distance from the origin (r) and the angle formed (θ).
6. The Exponential Blend: This conceptual blend characterizes the one-to-one correspondence between exponentials and logarithms, mapping sums onto products and vice versa. It links sequences of integers (n) to sequences of powers (b^n).
7. The Concept of e: Metaphorically, "e" is conceptualized as that number which is the base of a function that maps sums onto products and whose rate of change is identical to itself. This meaning is derived from metaphors that mathematize the concept of change.
8. Numbers Are Wholes That Are Sums of Their Parts Metaphor: This metaphor, revisited from Part 3, is used here to conceptualize numbers (like 'e') as sums of their parts, crucial for understanding power series.
9. Infinite Sums Are Limits of Infinite Sequences of Partial Sums Metaphor: This is a special case of the Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI), reiterated as fundamental for understanding power series as infinite sums of functions.
10. The Power-Series Blend: A complex blend that integrates the ideas of numbers as wholes and parts, functions as numbers, infinite sums, infinite series, and calculus applied to power series. It allows for the conceptualization of a function as an infinite sum of other functions.
11. The Multiplication-Rotation Blend: This blend (revisited from Part 4) results from the Multiplication by -1 Is Rotation to the Symmetry Point of n Metaphor, arithmetizing the 180° spatial rotation as multiplication by -1.
12. The Rotation-Number-Line Blend: A blend formed by combining the Multiplication-Rotation blend with the Number-Line blend, where multiplication by -1 correlates with a 180° rotation on the number line.
13. The Rotation-Plane Blend: This blend combines the Multiplication-Rotation blend with each Number-Line blend in the Cartesian plane, creating the concept of a "rotation plane" where specific rotational inferences can be made.
14. The 90° Rotation Metaphor: This metaphor introduces a metaphorical submapping where rotation by 90° (or π/2 radians) is conceptualized as multiplication by a number 'n' (which is later identified as 'i' or √-1). Applying this twice (two 90° rotations) corresponds to multiplication by n² (or i² = -1).
15. The Complex Plane (conceptualized as the 90° Rotation Plane): The complex plane is understood through the structure imposed by the 90° Rotation Metaphor, establishing conceptual connections between complex numbers, geometry, and rotations.
16. Functions Are Sets of Ordered Pairs Metaphor: This metaphor (revisited from Part 4/5) redefines functions from being conceptual rules to sets of ordered pairs of real numbers, which is crucial for equating functions with identical Taylor series.
17. The Trigonometric Complex Plane Blend: A new conceptual blend that integrates the Polar-Trigonometry Blend and the 90° Rotation-Plane Blend (the Complex Plane). It allows for the characterization of complex addition and multiplication in trigonometric terms.
18. Euler's Blend: This is the ultimate, complex conceptual blend that integrates the Power Series Blend, the Taylor Series Blend, the Exponential Complex Plane Blend, the Trigonometric Complex Plane Blend, and Sets of Ordered Pairs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ideas implicit in Euler's equation (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0).
19. Derivative Metaphor (Instantaneous Change Is Average Change over an Infinitely Small Interval): While introduced in earlier parts, it is specifically applied here to show how the derivative of the exponential function e^x is derived, linking change to rate of change.
Algorithms in Part 6
Part 6 does not introduce new, distinct algorithms. Instead, it demonstrates how conceptual metaphors and blends provide the cognitive structure that allows for the understanding and application of existing algorithmic processes in advanced mathematics. The discussion revolves around:
• Arithmetic calculations: How operations on numbers are extended metaphorically to functions and angles.
• Algebraic manipulations: The use of algebraic properties and equations to derive mathematical truths.
• Calculation of derivatives for power series: This process, as a consequence of the properties of derivatives, is enabled by the conceptual framework of the Power-Series blend.
• Computational aspects of proofs: The text acknowledges that proofs often involve "a lot of computation and putting together equations", and that algorithmic processes are central to the "mathematics of calculation".
The primary focus of Part 6, consistent with the book's overall aim, is on the cognitive and metaphorical meaning and structure that undergird these computational and algorithmic processes, rather than on detailing the algorithms themselves.
