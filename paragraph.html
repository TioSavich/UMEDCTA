                    <h3>Summary of Conceptual States</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Consciousness:</strong> Having immediate knowledge as its initial object. The approach to this object is also immediate and receptive, implying no alteration or comprehension.</li>
                      <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Initially defined as immediate knowledge, knowledge of the immediate or of what simply is.</li>
                      <li><strong>Sense-Certainty:</strong> The dialectic of sense-certainty is the simple history of its movement or of its experience. Natural consciousness always reaches this result but forgets it and starts over. The assertion that the reality of external things as "Thises" has absolute truth for consciousness is refuted as the opposite of universal experience. In all sense-certainty, consciousness learns that the "This" is a universal.</li>
                      <li><strong>Now:</strong> Pointing out the "Now" is a movement with three moments: 1) "Now" is asserted as truth, 2) "Now" is superseded, 3) The supersession is negated, returning to the first assertion. The true "Now" is a simple day containing many Nows (hours, minutes, etc.). Pointing out reveals that "Now" is a universal, a plurality of Nows taken together.</li>
                      <li><strong>Here:</strong> The "Here" pointed out is a this "Here" which is not this "Here", but a Before, Behind, Above, Below, Right, and Left. The "Here" that was supposed to be pointed out vanishes in other Heres. What abides is a negative This, a simple complex of many Heres. Pointing-out shows itself to be not an immediate knowing, but a movement from the "Here" that is meant through many Heres into the universal "Here".</li>
                      <li><strong>Language:</strong> Has the divine nature of directly reversing the meaning of what is said. Prevents what is meant from getting into words at all. When used to describe a sensuous "This", it would crumble away.</li>
                      <li><strong>This:</strong> When pointed out, it is a "Here" of other Heres, a simple togetherness of many Heres, i.e., a universal.</li>
                      <li><strong>Being:</strong> No longer an immediacy, but something to which negation and mediation are essential. Defined as an abstraction, or as the pure universal.</li>
                      <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Is all that is left over in the face of the empty or indifferent Now and Here. The true content of sense-certainty is not the universal for meaning.</li>
                      <li><strong>Object:</strong> Has become the unessential element in sense-certainty. Its truth is now in being "my" object, or in its being "mine" (Meinen).</li>
                      <li><strong>I:</strong> The "I" that does not disappear is the "I" as universal. Its seeing is a simple seeing, mediated by negation but indifferent to specific content. When "I" say "I", this singular "I", "I" say in general all "Is". Everyone is "I".</li>
                      <li><strong>Pointing-Out:</strong> Shows itself to be a movement into the universal "Here", a simple plurality of Heres.</li>
                      <li><strong>Unutterable:</strong> Identified as the untrue, the irrational, what is merely meant.</li>
