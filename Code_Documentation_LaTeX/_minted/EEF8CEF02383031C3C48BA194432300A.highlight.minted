=== CRITIQUE MECHANISM TESTS ===


[TEST] Stress Map: Recording Failures
  Stress tracking working correctly
  PASS

[TEST] Commitment Extraction from Proof
  Successfully extracted commitments from proof
  PASS

[TEST] Bad Infinite: Cycle Detection
  Cycle detection requires proof generation
  Structure defined (implementation pending)
  PASS

[TEST] Identify Most Stressed Commitment
  Correctly identified most stressed commitment
  PASS

[TEST] Resource Exhaustion: Stress Recording
Handling Resource Exhaustion for: [s(u)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(a))]
  Incremented stress for: [s(u)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(a))]
  Resource exhaustion recorded. External intervention required.
  Resource exhaustion recorded in stress map
  PASS

[TEST] Incoherence: Belief Revision
  Testing belief revision mechanism...
Handling Incoherence in Commitments: [([a,b]=\PYGZgt{}c)]
Retracting/Modifying stressed commitment: [a,b]=\PYGZgt{}c
Blocking problematic commitment: [a,b]=\PYGZgt{}c
  Belief revision attempted (dynamic assertion may vary)
  PASS

[TEST] Bad Infinite: Sublation Mechanism
  Testing sublation mechanism...
Handling Bad Infinite (Pathological Cycle): [node(pml\PYGZus{}rhythm((s(t\PYGZus{}b)=\PYGZgt{}s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}n)))),([s(t\PYGZus{}b)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}n))])),node(pml\PYGZus{}rhythm((s(t\PYGZus{}n)=\PYGZgt{}s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}b)))),([s(t\PYGZus{}n)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}b))]))]
  Detected oscillation between: [([s(t\PYGZus{}b)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}n))]),([s(t\PYGZus{}n)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}b))])]
  SUBLATION REQUIRED: Introduce higher\PYGZhy{}level concept to resolve oscillation
  Example: Being \PYGZlt{}\PYGZhy{}\PYGZgt{} Nothing requires \PYGZdq{}Becoming\PYGZdq{}
  System cannot auto\PYGZhy{}generate new concepts yet.
    Marked as stressed: [s(t\PYGZus{}b)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}n))] via pml\PYGZus{}rhythm((s(t\PYGZus{}b)=\PYGZgt{}s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}n))))
    Marked as stressed: [s(t\PYGZus{}n)]=\PYGZgt{}[s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}b))] via pml\PYGZus{}rhythm((s(t\PYGZus{}n)=\PYGZgt{}s(comp\PYGZus{}nec(t\PYGZus{}b))))
  External conceptual intervention required.
  Bad Infinite elements marked as stressed
  PASS
