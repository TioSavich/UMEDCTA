                      Through awareness of this completely developed object, consciousness
                      first becomes explicitly a consciousness that comprehends its object.

                      In the shape of content the moments look like they did when they first

                      subsistent ‘matters’, and on the other side, a One reflected into
                      itself, in which their independence is extinguished.

                      When we preserve the two moments in their immediate unity, the

                      sustains the different moments qua different.

                      Force is the unconditioned universal which is equally in its own self

                      self.

                    <li>
                      In order for Force to be in truth, it must be posited as the substance
                      of these differences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Force as such, or as driven back into itself, thus exists on its own
                      account as an exclusive One, for which the unfolding of the
                      [different] ‘matters’ is another subsisting essence.

                      But Force is also the whole, i.e. it remains what it is according to

                  <strong>Force:</strong>

                    <li>
                      Since it is conceived as Force or as reflected into itself, is one
                      side of its Notion, but posited as a substantial extreme and,
                      moreover, with the express character of a One.

                    <li>
                      The subsistence of the unfolded ‘matters’ outside of Force is thus
                      precluded and is something other than Force.

                    <li>
                      Since it is necessary that Force itself be this subsistence, or that
                      it express itself, its expression presents itself in this wise, that
                      the said ‘other’ approaches it and solicits it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We must retract the assertion that Force is posited as a One, and that
                      its essence is to express itself as an ‘other’ which approaches it
                      externally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Force is rather itself this universal medium in which the moments
                      subsist as ‘matters’; or, in other words, Force has expressed itself,
                      and what was supposed to be something else soliciting it is really
                      Force itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It exists, therefore, now as the medium of the unfolded ‘matters’. But
                      equally essentially it has the form of the supersession of the
                      subsisting ‘matters’, or is essentially a One.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Consequently, this oneness, since Force is posited as the medium of
                      the ‘matters’, is now something other than Force, which has this its
                      essence outside of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But, since Force must of necessity be this oneness which it is not as
                      yet posited as being, this ‘other’ approaches it, soliciting it to
                      reflect itself into itself: in other words, Force supersedes its
                      expression.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But in fact Force is itself this reflectedness-into-self, or this
                      supersession of the expression. The oneness, in the form in which it
                      appeared, viz. as an ‘other’, vanishes; Force is this ‘other’ itself,
                      is Force that is driven back into itself.

                    <li>
                      What appears as an ‘other’ and solicits Force, both to expression and
                      to a return into itself, directly proves to be itself Force.

                    <li>
                      There are at the same time two Forces present; the Notion of both is
                      no doubt the same, but it has gone forth from its unity into a
                      duality.

                    <li>
                      The second Force appears as the one that solicits and, moreover, in
                      accordance with its content, as the universal medium in relation to
                      the Force characterized as the one solicited.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But since the second Force is essentially an alternation of these two
                      moments and is itself Force, it is likewise the universal medium only
                      through its being solicited to be such; and similarly, too, it is a
                      negative unity, i.e. it solicits the retraction of Force [into
                      itself], only through its being solicited to do so.

                      The interplay of the two Forces thus consists in their being

                      determination, and in the absolute, immediate alternation of the
                      determinations—consists, i.e. in a transition through which alone
                      these determinations are in which the Forces seem to make an

                      The soliciting Force is posited as a universal medium, and the one
                      solicited, on the other hand, as Force driven back into itself; but
                      the former is a universal medium only through the other being Force
                      that is driven back into itself; or, it is really the latter that is
                      the soliciting Force for the other and is what makes it a medium.

                    <li>
                      The first Force has its determinateness only through the other, and
                      solicits only in so far as the other solicits it to be a soliciting
                      Force; and, just as directly, it loses the determinateness given to
                      it, for this passes over—or rather has already passed over—to the
                      other.

                    <li>
                      The external, soliciting Force appears as a universal medium, but only
                      through its having been solicited by the other Force to do so; but
                      this means that the latter gives it that character and is really
                      itself essentially a universal medium; it gives the soliciting Force
                      this character just because this other determination is essential to
                      it, i.e. because this is really its own self.

                      The differences themselves are exhibited in a twofold difference: once

                      itself, but the other the medium of the ‘matters’; and again as a
                      difference of form, since one solicits and the other is solicited, the
                      former being active and the other passive.

                      According to the difference of content they are distinguished [merely]
                      in principle, or for us; but according to the difference of form they
                      are independent and in their relation keep themselves separate and
                      opposed to one another.

                      The fact that the extremes, from the standpoint of both these sides,
                      are thus nothing in themselves, that these sides in which their
                      different essences were supposed to consist are only vanishing
                      moments, are an immediate transition of each into its opposite, this

                    <li>
                      But for us, as remarked above, something more was apparent, viz. that
                      the differences, qua differences of content and form, vanished in

                      independent side, was the same as that which, on the side of content,
                      presented itself as Force driven back into itself; the side which was
                      passive, which was solicited or for an other, was, from the side of
                      form, the same as that which, from the side of content, presented
                      itself as the universal medium of the many ‘matters’.

                  <strong>Force:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The Notion of Force becomes actual through its duplication into two
                      Forces, and how it comes to be so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      These two Forces exist as independent essences; but their existence is
                      a movement of each towards the other, such that their being is rather
                      a pure positedness or a being that is posited by an other, i.e. their
                      being has really the significance of a sheer vanishing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They do not exist as extremes which retain for themselves something
                      fixed and substantial, transmitting to one another in their middle
                      term and in their contact a merely external property; on the contrary,
                      what they are, they are, only in this middle term and in this contact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In this, there is immediately present both the repression within
                      itself of Force, or its being-for-self, as well as its expression:
                      Force that solicits and Force that is solicited.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Consequently, these moments are not divided into two independent
                      extremes offering each other only an opposite extreme: their essence
                      rather consists simply and solely in this, that each is solely through
                      the other, and what each thus is it immediately no longer is, since it
                      is the other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      They have thus, in fact, no substances of their own which might
                      support and maintain them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The Notion of Force rather preserves itself as the essence in its very
                      actuality; Force, as actual, exists simply and solely in its
                      expression, which at the same time is nothing else than a supersession
                      of itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This actual Force, when thought of as free from its expression and as
                      being for itself, is Force driven back into itself; but in fact this
                      determinateness, as we have found, is itself only a moment of Force’s
                      expression.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Thus the truth of Force remains only the thought of it; the moments of
                      its actuality, their substances and their movement, collapse
                      unresistingly into an undifferentiated unity, a unity which is not
                      Force driven back into itself (for this is itself only such a moment),
                      but is its Notion qua Notion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Thus the realization of Force is at the same time the loss of reality;
                      in that realization it has really become something quite different,
                      viz. this universality, which the Understanding knows at the outset,
                      or immediately, to be its essence and which also proves itself to be
                      such in the supposed reality of Force, in the actual substances.

                    <li>
                      If we regard the first universal as the Understanding’s Notion in
                      which Force is not yet for itself, the second is now Force’s essence
                      as it exhibits itself in and for itself.

                    <li>
                      Or, conversely, if we regard the first universal as the Immediate,
                      which was supposed to be an actual object for consciousness, then this
                      second is determined as the negative of Force that is objective to
                      sense; it is Force in the form of its true essence in which it exists
                      only as an object for the Understanding.

                    <li>
                      The first universal would be Force driven back into itself, or Force
                      as Substance; the second, however, is the inner being of things qua
                      inner, which is the same as the Notion of Force qua Notion.

                    <li>
                      Has a mediated relation to the inner being and, as the Understanding,
                      looks through this mediating play of Forces into the true background
                      of Things.

                    <li>
                      Consciousness, therefore, reflects itself out of this movement back
                      into itself as the True; but, qua consciousness, converts this truth
                      again into an objective inner, and distinguishes this reflection of
                      Things from its own reflection into itself: just as the movement of
                      mediation is likewise still objective for it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This inner is, therefore, for consciousness an extreme over against
                      it; but it is for consciousness the True, since in the inner, as the
                      in-itself, it possesses at the same time the certainty of itself, or
                      the moment of its being-for-self.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But it is not yet conscious of this ground or basis, for the
                      being-for-self which the inner was supposed to possess in its own self
                      would be nothing else but the negative movement. This, however, is for
                      consciousness still the objective vanishing appearance, not yet its
                      own being-for-self.

                    <li>
                      Consequently, the inner is for it certainly Notion, but it does not as
                      yet know the nature of the Notion.

                    <li>
                      The middle term which unites the two extremes, the Understanding and
                      the inner world, is the developed being of Force which, for the
                      Understanding itself, is henceforth only a vanishing. This ‘being’ is
                      therefore called appearance.

                    <li>
                      But it is not merely a surface show; it is appearance, a totality of
                      show. This totality, as totality or as a universal, is what
                      constitutes the inner [of Things], the play of Forces as a reflection
                      of the inner into itself.

                      Certainly, we have no knowledge of this inner world as it is here in

                      limited, or however else one likes to call it—on this point, we know
                      nothing as yet because we have not yet gone deep enough—but because of
                      the simple nature of the matter in hand, that is to say, because in

                      The inner world, or supersensible beyond, has, however, come into
                      being: it comes from the world of appearance which has mediated it; in

                      We completely misunderstand this if we think that the supersensible
                      world is therefore the sensuous world, or the world as it exists for
                      immediate sense-certainty and perception; for the world of appearance
                      is, on the contrary, not the world of sense-knowledge and perception
                      as a world that positively is, but this world posited as superseded,
                      or as in truth an inner world.

                  <strong>Play of Forces:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      What is immediate for the Understanding is the play of Forces; but
                      what is the True for it, is the simple inner world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The movement of Force is therefore the True, likewise only as
                      something altogether simple.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This play of Forces is so constituted that the Force which is
                      solicited by another Force is equally the soliciting Force for that
                      other, which only thereby becomes itself a soliciting Force.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What is present in this interplay is likewise merely the immediate
                      alternation, or the absolute interchange, of the determinateness which
                      constitutes the sole content of what appears: to be either a universal
                      medium, or a negative unity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It ceases immediately on its appearance in determinate form to be what
                      it was on appearing; by appearing in determinate form, it solicits the
                      other side to express itself, i.e. the latter is now immediately what
                      the first was supposed to be.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Each of these two sides, the relation of soliciting and the relation
                      of the opposed determinate content, is on its own account an absolute
                      reversal and interchange [of the determinateness].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But these two relations themselves are again one and the same; and the
                      difference of form, of being the solicited and the soliciting Force,
                      is the same as the difference of content, of being the solicited Force
                      as such, viz. the passive medium on the one hand, and the soliciting
                      Force, the active, negative unity or the One, on the other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In this way there vanishes completely all distinction of separate,
                      mutually contrasted Forces which were supposed to be present in this
                      movement, for they rested solely on those distinctions; and the
                      distinction between the Forces, along with both those distinctions,
                      likewise collapses into only one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Thus there is neither Force, nor the act of soliciting or being
                      solicited, nor the determinateness of being a stable medium and a
                      unity reflected into itself, there is neither something existing
                      singly by itself, nor are there diverse antitheses; on the contrary,
                      what there is in this absolute flux is only difference as a universal
                      difference, or as a difference into which the many antitheses have
                      been resolved.

                      This difference, as a universal difference, is consequently the simple
                      element in the play of Force itself and what is true in it. It is the
                      law of Force.

                      The absolute flux of appearance becomes a simple difference through

                      Is, to begin with, only implicitly the universal; but this implicit,
                      simple universal is essentially no less absolutely universal
                      difference, for it is the outcome of the flux itself, or the flux is
                      its essence; but it is a flux that is posited in the inner world as it
                      is in truth, and consequently it is received in that inner world as
                      equally an absolute universal difference that is absolutely at rest
                      and remains selfsame.

                      In other words, negation is an essential moment of the universal, and
                      negation, or mediation in the universal, is therefore a universal
                      difference.

                      This realm of laws is indeed the truth for the Understanding, and that
                      truth has its content in the law.

                    <li>
                      At the same time, however, this realm is only the initial truth for
                      the Understanding and does not fill out the world of appearance.

                    <li>
                      The Understanding imagines that in this unification it has found a
                      universal law which expresses universal reality as such; but in fact
                      it has only found the Notion of law itself, although in such a way
                      that what it is saying is that all reality is in its own self,
                      conformable to law.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In this the law is present, but is not the entire presence of
                      appearance; with every change of circumstance the law has a different
                      actuality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Thus appearance retains for itself an aspect which is not in the inner
                      world; i.e. appearance is not yet truly posited as appearance, as a
                      superseded being-for-self.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This defect in the law must equally be made manifest in the law
                      itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What seems to be defective in it is that while it does contain
                      difference, the difference is universal, indeterminate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      However, in so far as it is not law in general, but a law, it does
                      contain determinateness; consequently, there are indefinitely many
                      laws.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But this plurality is itself rather a defect; for it contradicts the
                      principle of the Understanding for which, as consciousness of the
                      simple inner world, the True is the implicitly universal unity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It must therefore let the many laws collapse into one law, just as,
                      e.g., the law by which a stone falls, and the law by which the
                      heavenly bodies move, have been grasped as one law.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      But when the laws thus coincide, they lose their specific character.

                    <li>
                      The law becomes more and more superficial, and as a result what is
                      found is, in fact, not the unity of these specific laws, but a law
                      which leaves out their specific character; just as the one law which
                      combines in itself the laws of falling terrestrial bodies and of the
                      motions of the heavenly bodies, in fact expresses neither law.

                    <li>
                      The unification of all laws in universal attraction expresses no other
                      content than just the mere Notion of law itself, which is posited in
                      that law in the form of being.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Universal attraction merely asserts that everything has a constant
                      difference in relation to other things.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The expression, universal attraction, is of great importance in so far
                      as it is directed against the thoughtless way in which everything is
                      pictured as contingent, and for which determinateness has the form of
                      sensuous independence.

                      Thus, in contrast to specific laws, we have universal attraction, or

                    <li>
                      In so far as this pure Notion is looked on as the essence, or the true
                      inner being, the determinateness of the specific law itself still
                      belongs to appearance, or rather to sensuous being.

                      But the pure Notion of law transcends not merely the law which, being
                      itself a specific law, stands contrasted with other specific laws, but
                      also transcends law as such.

                    <li>
                      The determinateness of which we spoke is itself really only a

                      essential, for here it is only the law that is the True; but the
                      Notion of law is turned against law itself.

                    <li>
                      That is to say, in the law the difference itself is grasped
                      immediately and taken up into the universal, thereby, however, giving
                      the moments whose relation is expressed by the law a subsistence in
                      the form of indifferent and [merely] implicit essentialities.

                      But these parts of the difference present in the law are at the same
                      time themselves determinate sides; the pure Notion of law as universal
                      attraction must, to get its true meaning, be grasped in such a way
                      that in it, as what is absolutely simple or unitary, the differences
                      present in law as such themselves return again into the inner world as
                      a simple unity. This unity is the inner necessity of the law.

                      the differences themselves of what attracts and what is attracted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In this sense, simple electricity, e.g., is Force; but the expression
                      of difference falls within the law; this difference is positive and
                      negative electricity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Electricity itself is not difference per se, or is not in its essence
                      the dual essence of positive and negative electricity; hence, it is
                      usually said that it has the law of this mode of being, and, too, that
                      it has the property of expressing itself in this way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It is true that this property is the essential and sole property of
                      this Force, or that it belongs to it necessarily. But necessity here
                      is an empty word; Force must, just because it must, duplicate itself
                      in this way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Electricity, as simple Force, is indifferent to its law—to be positive
                      and negative; and if we call the former its Notion but the latter its
                      being, then its Notion is indifferent to its being. It merely has this
                      property, which just means that this property is not in itself
                      necessary to it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This indifference is given another form when it is said that to be
                      positive and negative belongs to the definition of electricity, and
                      that this is simply its Notion and essence. In that case, its being
                      would simply mean its actual existence. But that definition does not
                      contain the necessity of its existence; it exists, either because we
                      find it, i.e. its existence is not necessary at all, or console.log("script.js loaded");
